We will be hosting Srinivas Kodali in an AMA today 6 PM. He is an independent researcher who has been documenting the Aadhaar project along with several other researchers. His work made him file public interest litigation against the illegal voter deletions by ECI using Aadhaar and NPR data.

On our request, he sent us the following text explaining the significance of NPR.

> The national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan. The project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when India realised it can't identify the foreigners from indians. During a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001, the project was approved. Part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed Multi Purpose National Identity Cards, which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip. While this project was being piloted, India went through another attack on 26/11/08 in Mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen.  This is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on. 

> But post 26/11, due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like NATGRID, CCTNS, CMS, Aadhaar poppped up. Aadhaar project and NPR were very similar. So to deal with it, the cabinet combined both of them, the registar general of india became a registrar under UIDAI and started distributing Aadhaar. The deal was NPR will get biometrics from UIDAI post de-duplication, but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyone. 

> After all of this, NPR project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015. The project in itself is the start of National Register of Citizens. NPR data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residents.

His Twitter: https://twitter.com/digitaldutta

Recently he published an article on NRC-NPR-Aadhaar nexus on thewire.in. Please feel free to go through it ~ [Digital India on Steroids: How Aadhaar Infra Enables the NPR and the NRC.

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

Last year I happened to be in the news when me and my partner telecasted live the moral policing we faced from the female police officers in a park here. Now, it seems I have drawn attention back to me when it became news when I posted a bare breast picture in Facebook , protesting against hypersexualising female bodies, especially since the topic of breasts is being talked about like never before in the public discourse of Kerala. Feel free to clear your doubts regarding my move 🙂

Greetings [/r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)!

Tomorrow, August 24, marks the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on the Right to Privacy judgement. This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.

If you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. If you use duckduckgo, show up. If you didn't link your Aadhaar to anything, show up. If you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

Collectively, we are the #SaveOurPrivacy drafting volunteers. Our twitter handles are below.

Thank you so much for making this AMA so much fun! I learned so much about India and I can relate to you all so much! I wish we could all get along better. We are literal kin, far back and deep down. I would love to come to India some day and meet people as lovely and hilarious and curious as you lot! And I'd love it if you guys came down to my country, too!

Finally, I'll leave you all with a quote from A Song of Ice and Fire which reminds me about the partition, and what a tragedy it was, and how we can all strive to do better, and love each other as the brothers and sisters we really are:

>“It all goes back and back,"" Tyrion thought, ""to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.”

Let's not be puppets. Let's love and share and break the cycle that has been handed down to us.

He called on mental health professionals and others to empower people with the right knowledge so that they make informed decisions. 

Inspired by this, in 2014, White Swan Foundation was founded. This week, we complete 4 years! 

On our portals, we offer content in six languages, have over 600 articles in English alone, and over 100 videos on our YouTube channel. We’ve also reached out to over 2000 people in our outreach programmes with schools, colleges, ASHA workers, etc. You can see some of those pictures [here.](https://imgur.com/a/2dfBO)

Today, there is 20% chance that one of us will develop a mental health issue sometime in our lifetime. The treatment gap for mental health issues is over 85% which means for every 100 people with mental health issues, only 15 get treatment! We believe that the stigma of mental health and illness can be drastically reduced by knowledge and awareness.

We want to curate many more such conversations until going to a mental health professional for a mental health concern is just as easy and natural as going to a doctor for the flu!

Also, we are doing a [survey on Mental health at the workplace in India](https://goo.gl/forms/KyCnYqtFB9FT2Rps2) and would love it if you filled it out and shared it with others.

Hey, my name is Raghav Mandava, and I am one of the first comedians from Delhi. I was at the very first open mic organized in Delhi in the summer of 2009. I have played a major part in shaping the current comedy industry and even some of the comedians you may know today.

• In 2010 I started a company called Cheese Monkey Mafia for organizing open mics and pub gigs. Many house hold names of today did their first five minutes at the shows I organized.

• My additional skill set is best explained as a producer and talent scout. There is an article I wrote in 2015 about some of the upcoming comedians that I thought people should see, https://lbb.in/delhi/raghav-mandava-delhi-comics/

• I have even shot sketches and videos for comedians, here is an example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYsrdh15XY8

• In 2014/15 I worked with the Australian High Commission to host their comedy competition RAW, where the winners went and performed in the Melbourne Comedy Festival

• In May 2014, I was lucky enough to be on the opening Weekend of a comedy club in Malaysia called the CrackHouse.

• 2017 Got featured in GQ Man of the year edition, but not as one of the men of year.

• Here are a couple of clips of my work

If people here are curious about the inner workings of comedy, and how it has changed over the last decade, I would love to offer my insights.

[Our previous thread is linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7rq17h/requesting_help_from_redditors_for_the_entire/), as well as a few older ones about this particular IIT [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5824lx/iitindore_to_introduce_60_hostel_reservation_for/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4s29ba/pg_students_at_iit_indore_are_facing_some_severe/).

As you can clearly see in the aforementioned three threads, our IIT has been at the centre of controversy for years, mainly due to an administration that believes in an autocratic style of functioning. This is an IIT in which even faculties and staff are not allowed to speak to media (this is actually part of the IIT Indore statutes).

The aforementioned three reddit threads should provide the relevant background on the origin and cause of the current standoff and lack of official/written communication between students and the administration.

With that said and done, we welcome questions from the community at /r/India. We would also like you to go through the **[announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vtxad/ama_announcement_protesting_students_from_iit/)** for this AMA, where a brief (!!) background is given for the issues at hand.

Thank you all for your valuable time. As the issues are still not solved, we would greatly appreciate if any mediapersons reading this AMA would reach out to us.

Hey everyone!

I am Jaya Ramchandani. I am a science communicator and have recently started to teach IB physics and general science.

I have been working with innovative educational projects making astronomy and physics accessible to the general public. 

Today, I am here to answer questions related to interdisciplinary projects like art meets science, informal, out-of-the classroom learning, and lifelong learning for all.

I co-founded 'The Story Of' Foundation because while studying physics I found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are similar to Eastern philosophy. So I started to ask the question then, why doesn’t contemporary science talk more often to Eastern philosophy? That was one of the bigger motivations behind setting up the platform. We involved artists and designers in a big way because they are great at thinking about abstract topics and giving them form.

You can see our past project The Story of Light 2015 here: www.thestoryoflight.org. The Story of Light received international recognition in the UN’s International Year of Light education and outreach panel. 

In the upcoming project, The Story of Space 2017, http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/ we welcome everyone to join us in Goa from 10th November to 19th November for our festival. The Story of Space provides unique learning experiences around space exploration, migration, urban architecture and other contemporary issues associated with the word ‘space’. Essentially, we explore ‘space’ from multiple perspectives. Artists, scientists, educators, and philosophers have all come to Goa to create live experiences, a film program, installations, workshops, talks, and panels. The 10-day festival is for the general public, across generations, and is FREE for all to experience. Story of Space 2017.

"Marrying my Japanese colleague, AMA.",315,Casual AMA,akimera,8ef6pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ef6pj/marrying_my_japanese_colleague_ama/,231,1524548246.0,"Long time lurker here, but today's been a great day for me so I thought I'll post the news here - I'm marrying my Japanese colleague after working together for 4 years. Our folks have finally met, and contrary to the usual drama one would expect, everything went well and our families are genuinely happy for us. We tie the knot by year end. 
 
Her father's English is fine, but her mother really doesn't speak the language (appreciate the effort though) - mostly unintelligible. Still, I translated where needed and filled in the blanks.

All the while waifu-to-be was a wee bit nervous with the whole interaction scene, but it turned out to be a lovely evening. They've traveled a long way and I was joking how the roles have reversed in contrast with traditional Indian norms where the prospect groom is expected to visit the bride and her family.
 
Mom had seen her photos on my Facebook, but was overly impressed with her skin and hair in person, to the point I had to ask her to tone it down a bit with the awkward complements. My dad and her dad got into conversations around food and a bunch of other stuff. 
 
I guess I'm writing this because it's a bit surreal how smooth everything has been. Her folks had zero issues with their daughter dating a gaijin, maybe because they knew where I worked, and my folks are just happy I didn't turn out to be gay (they had suspected so for a while on extremely silly grounds). Had it been an Indian partner, I don't think it would have been this straightforward.

Anyway, I'm tired and will crash, but feel free to ask me anything about Japan, work and life there, partners and dating etc.

Just want to make a note that we're very low-key, sober and laidback as a couple. She does not look like a dolled up AV model, I do not look like Tom Cruise's Indian cousin, and we're both quite career minded. So please don't ask questions like it's r/indiansgonewild.

"AMA : I orchestrated a protest against an impossible force(corrupt businessmen,media, politicians & police) for justice in India and won. It changed the system in an entire state. This post is meant to be a guide for whistleblowers on ""How to run a successful campaign in India as an ordinary person""",551,Casual AMA,HelpSaveStudents,8gziej,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gziej/ama_i_orchestrated_a_protest_against_an/,79,1525471683.0,"Last year, I had made a [post on this very subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) asking your help to fight against injustice. I was a desperate person at that time and didn't think that there is any chance that it will be successful. After writing that post, I unknowingly became the mastermind behind a protest against corrupt college administrators, corrupt police officers and the media which would refuse to listen to us because they were getting money from these corrupt people.

This incident involves the torture and the death of a student caused by the college management, bribing the police and media to keep quiet, several months of protests which bloomed into a state-wide-unrest forcing the politicians to change sides, arrest & imprisonment of the absconding chairman of a college, vice principal, owners etc and finally the reform of the education system of an entire state! And, I was the one who orchestrated the protest which resulted in all of this. I spent every conscious hour of two months of my life working behind this campaign.

I dont want to repeat the entire incident, so you can read about the incident in detail in it's well written [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_College_of_Engineering_and_Research_Centre). Make sure to read about the student death controversy and then the police report which is below under different subsection. Also you can go through my old posts in this subreddit like [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) and [this photo](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5niiw4/this_is_not_saudi_arabia_they_are_not_muslims/)

I am making this AskMeAnything so that my experience can help people who think ""I am just an ordinary person, I can't change the system, I can't protest against injustice."" or ""They are rich and corrupt, so there is no way to bring them to justice, so I should better move on with my life and do nothing"" or ""All the problems is due to the current system/government and I can't do anything about it"".

I was a no one in this incident. I didn't know the victim. I was not even a student of that college at that time. I was an ex-student. I had no ""benefit"" in doing any of this. Also, I did all of it anonymously. No one except about 5 friends know that I was working behind the scenes. 

Also, my major contribution was in directing the protest, contacting the right people, managing the information and running the campaign. I did majority of it by just sitting in a room with a laptop. There were hundreds of other brave people who staged the protest and did the things which I wanted to be done.

I didn't start out thinking I will coordinate this protest or spend so much time on it. This all started out when I started a Facebook page asking justice for the victim. I regularly posted new content and people started contacting me with new information or asking me what they should do. Within few days, I was having so much contact with so many people from various backgrounds like students, teachers, reporters, lawyers, ex-students, parents etc that I unknowingly became the one who was running the entire campaign both online and offline.

So many people selflessly helped in finding information. Some law students of other colleges volunteered to write legal notices or other such stuff. Some people traveled great distances to find certain information. Some people had contacts with politicians and was able to mobilize partymen. Some brought in media. Some were reporters who were directly taking content from me and posting it. Some were helping in the creation of the content. And, I had to ensure that the content I was providing is true.

After about a month of work, it started showing signs of success. We started to get the attention of mainstream media who started posting the full details without censoring anything. Then, few weeks later, this became the headline news of all the newspapers in the state. It became the talk of the town. I overheard so many people discussing about this incident while travelling in trains or buses.

Then, student protests broke out at many private colleges across the state demanding student unions and fighting against injustices. Few colleges even lost their affiliation and closed down due to this incident. And, students of one such engineering college was transferred to better colleges. My friends and relatives at several other colleges said that the situation has improved after this incident.

Anyways even though I am an ""trying to be former"" omnivore(I know, it's complicated :D), I only cook vegetarian fare at home, as the wife would kick me out if I even suggested bringing home anything other than vegetarian. You can have a gander at some of the stuff I cooked here :

I think anyone can learn to cook and in this day and age everyone should cook, even if it's just the basic stuff, to be self reliant.

I don't proclaim to be the master on the subject matter, but I do consider myself to be experienced enough to answer your questions as I love to consume anything related to cooking, be it books, articles or videos.

"Hey Reddit! I am Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay India Bitcoin Exchange. Ask me anything!",98,AMA,goenkasandeep,5e3mni,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5e3mni/hey_reddit_i_am_sandeep_goenka_cofounder_of/,218,1479757471.0,"Hi /r/India,

I am Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay, an app-enabled bitcoin wallet and exchange.

**About Bitcoin**

Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system. It is commonly called a decentralized digital currency. It was invented in 2009. It is an open source software. This means, that no person, company or country owns this network just like no one owns the Internet. The system is peer-to-peer, that is, users can transact directly without an intermediary like a bank, a credit card company or a clearing house. Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. 

Short explanation on what is bitcoin: https://youtu.be/jiEllBFNaMA

A longer version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmU28mgihB4

**About Zebpay & Sandeep Goenka**

Zebpay is a bitcoin app available for Android and iPhones. It is the most popular bitcoin exchange in India. Users can buy / sell bitcoins, top up airtime and buy vouchers of Flipkart, Amazon and more. Zebpay is the first in the industry to launch bitcoin wallet app that enables bitcoin transactions using a mobile number without any complexities to understand bitcoin addresses, taking backups or fear of losing bitcoins. 

In just a year, Zebpay app has clocked 150,000 downloads and crossed a turnover of Rs 450 crores. After early adopters, bitcoins are attracting a new class of users like young professionals and HNIs. Users are now using bitcoin as an alternative investment. They are also using it for online shopping, airtime top up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers. We believe India will see an explosion of digital assets like bitcoins in next 2 years. Zebpay is on a mission to spread digital assets and bitcoins in India.

The walk is a project of the Veditum India Foundation, and is being undertaken independently by me. A team from our production partner Digital Nerve comprising of Ayan Sil and Rahul Mitra are filming a documentary and capturing photographs. Ardra Venugopal, a Veditum fellow is working on cross sector research in relation to the river and the people living alongside it. We are recording real life experiences of people and the vivid sounds of nature, documenting success stories and that of distress related to the river, collecting social & scientific data and bringing out a first person narrative of the river as a co-living entity, if not the protagonist that it is. The idea is to use research in vivid ways to capture the attention of the audience and speak to them of the state of affairs, not just qualitatively but quantitatively as well. The project provides a platform to collect data for environmental research being conducted across the nation in various institutes.

Through these endeavours, we could raise both funds and awareness for the mentioned causes, translating directly into impact at many fronts.

I am Tathagata Satpathy, elected Member of Parliament and Chief Whip of Biju Janata Dal in Lok Sabha. This is the 4th time I am serving as an MP (12th, 14th, 15th & 16th Lok Sabha). I am a journalist by profession and I am the editor of two newspapers, Dharitri (Oriya) and Orissa POST (English).

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

EDIT (19:53 IST, March 20, 2015): I got some brilliant points from Redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already! After a not so busy week in parliament, let me try answering a few more questions.

The Freedom 251 is the world's cheapest smartphone. It was launched in India by a Noida-based company called Ringing Bells for just Rs. 251. What's the catch? Nothing (as far as we can tell).

The device raised more questions than answers: the company says the government isn't subsidising the device; there's a Adcom logo on the front of the device, which was concealed with whitener; and the phone, which is being pitched as a Made in India device for the Prime Minister Digital India plan, blatantly rips off the user interface of Apple's iOS.

I'm here to take any questions you have about the phone. Fire away.

"Hi Reddit, i'm Siddharth Agarwal & i'm currently on a walk (~3000kms) along the river Ganga from sea to source and i have already walked 2000kms since 6th June.

The experiences have maintained my understanding that there’s a need to bring these important conversations into the mainstream. This campaign will help us learn and share with you stories of the people of the basin who depend on the river and what urban/rural/industrial activities are doing to the river.

Last time we did an AmA [https://redd.it/4saxeh] i had covered 500kms and was waiting to sort out some logistical issues to continue the journey. 

Current status :

I'm done with over 75% of the journey and it has been an exceptionally challenging task over the course of the past 4 months. For those who have been following the journey from the beginning, it might come as a surprise that i have been by myself and not accompanied by a documentary crew as was the case when i started (refer to previous AmA). Restricted by personal reasons and security concerns, the crew decided to drop out after they had covered the stretch in West Bengal. Though this affected the design of the project as envisioned and also induced a fair bit of mental agony, it helped me re-emphasize my belief that the only limitations are the ones that we put on ourselves.

What this has done though, is that it helped me survive longer on the road with the same amount of funds we were able to raise in the first round of crowdfunding. We'll soon be going live with a second round of crowdfunding, since the first round didn’t reach our target and use that to support the Moving Upstream series of projects, which is soon going to witness an expansion. This includes an opportunity for more young people to undergo river journeys with the support of Veditum India Foundation, to help us understand, visualize and thereby improve the situation at the grassroots.

This is Urjit Yajnik, Physics Professor, but also the unenviable erstwhile Dean of Student Affairs, IIT Bombay from roughly during 2011 to 2015, a position fondly or otherwise called DoSA.  

Here is the [proof](https://i.imgur.com/bMcINPp.png).

I have agreed to do AMA with due encouragement and prodding by [InsIghT](https://www.facebook.com/insight.iitbombay), our own loveable if noisome media body. And they have offered to stand by me through this session, as much as media stand by officials, I guess.

Let me set the ball rolling by what is on my mind as I face the large general body of people but majority of whom are most likely the sufferers of my ""regime"". I am opening up in this particular session to questions that are related to   

* Matters pertaining to IIT Bombay; more generally to the IIT system  
* Higher technological education, in India and worldwide  
* General issues about career choices, future of the relationship between technology and society and what, with my limited crystal ball gazing abilities, may be your available strategies to navigate that.  

To kick off, let me make three points :  

1. What was my abiding motto for handing the DoSA job? It was that students of IIT Bombay and of a campus and academic environment similar to IIT Bombay should live in a self-governed, participatory environment. As you know we have no resident wardens in individual hostels, though the faculty Wardens are only a stone’s throw away. I relied mostly on the fact that students have a responsibility to their own lives and those of
their fellow residents of the campus. And I received ample justification to this belief, in the initiatives and tasks that student representatives or individuals took up, sometimes for the larger student body but often also just for that individual who needed help the most. 

2. IIT Bombay is at present blazing a trail. From the exposure to faculty research output, to the inspiration and infrastructure they receive from IIT Bombay, students and alumni have made the most to put the Institute in the forefront. A large number of alumni and well wishers have also devoted substantial amounts of time and resources to make this happen. We see the culture of fundamental contributions to technology, to management and innovation, as well as to entrepreneurship to grow in the time to come.

3. Career choices. As the world becomes both information loaded and also small in terms of the rapidity and reach of ideas and products, it becomes a challenge to decide how to steer and navigate through this environment. So long as you navigate yourself ethically and are making a definite contribution to the  larger good, you are fine.

Well, so those are the thoughts with which I start. Now let's AMA away!


**[Volunteer's note: Prof. Yajnik will start answering questions at around 9.30 pm. Feel free to post your questions till then]**

**EDIT:** The AMA is now done. Prof. Yajnik spent about five hours on this, answering 50 questions. Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as we did :D",2015-07-06 04:16:18
"Hey /r/india, I’m Amrit, a Delhi-based social entrepreneur and chatbot developer. Ask Me Anything about Air Pollution!",86,AMA,0096147,5fvxfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fvxfa/hey_rindia_im_amrit_a_delhibased_social/,95,1480617446.0,"Air pollution sucks.

I believe that clean air is a basic human right. We are a very long way away from having clean air in Delhi, most parts of North India, and around the world. Air pollution in cities across the country even the likes of Bombay and Madras are unhealthy (just not as bad as Delhi).


Shocking Facts About Air Pollution:

1. 92% of the people in the world  don't have access to clean air.

2. 6.5 million people die prematurely every year because of air pollution. That's more than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and traffic accidents combined.

3. Scientists don't yet know the precise extent of health affects of sustained exposure to very unhealthy and hazardous air quality levels, because most air quality research thus far has been done in countries with relatively much much cleaner air than India.


There is no reason why air pollution data shouldn’t be as easy to access and understand as weather data. I’m working to make that happen for worldwide air quality data at http://www.AirAirAir.org.

I built Smokey - It's a friendly air pollution chatbot that works in Facebook Messenger. It is the easiest way to monitor the air quality levels in your city every day, and learn what you can do about it to protect yourself. You can search for “smokey air” in Facebook Messenger app, or just click on http://m.me/smokeybot. It's totally free and works like magic for cities around the world in 33 countries.


Prior to this, I launched a simple twitter bot, [DelhivsWorld](http://www.twitter.com/delhivsworld) - it tweets out hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels compared to Beijing, London, New  York and Sydney.


I definitely don’t have all the answers, but I want to hear your experiences about air pollution and help in any way I can, especially by democratizing air pollution data in a way that's super easy to access and understand for absolutely everyone with an internet connection.


**Let’s talk air pollution.**

I have a simple question for you: Do you know the air quality in your city today? Do you wear a face mask? Why or Why not?

This AMA is on behalf of my grandfather. A few days ago [I posted](http://imgur.com/a/rQ210) pictures of his pre-Independence British Passport that was issued to him when he had to travel to the Middle East in early 1947. The post generated a lot of interest and people had questions for him and requested an AMA.

I've frequently talked to him about his experiences and he has told me bits and pieces over the years. It's really fascinating to listen to because it was a completely-different time, and it's amazing listening to someone who actually lived through those times.

My grandfather is 93 years old. He went to UC College in Aluva, but didn't finish his degree, instead deciding to run away and join the military. He took a train from Chennai to Lahore for basic training, and then went to Bombay for a Wireless Operators Course. After that he spent a few months in Hyderabad where he was promoted to Sergeant. 

He was then posted to Ramree Island off the coast of Burma with the 4th squadron of the Royal Indian Air force to help them conduct recce operations against the Imperial Japanese Army. After the end of the war he was offered a chance to be part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, but instead opted to leave the military.

He worked for Kodak for a bit and then was offered a job with the Iraq Petroleum Company, which he took. This was when he was issued his passport. 

Because of his age and because he recently had some surgery he gets easily tired and I don't want to exert him too much. As a result he won't be able to answer your questions immediately. But please do post them and I will start going over them tomorrow morning and will transcribe his answers. Also, there are some details he can't remember so I apologize in advance if he is not able to answer some of your questions.

[Ask him anything!](http://imgur.com/0m8sek0)

Also, [proof](http://imgur.com/J6yEqca).

**EDIT**: It is **9:00 AM** IST right now. My grandpa let me know that he has a doctor's appointment, but we should be back by around **10:15 AM** IST or so to answer the rest of the questions. Sorry for the delay, but he is still very interested in answering the questions! 

**UPDATE 1**: My grandpa is back!

**UPDATE 2**: Taking a break for lunch - will come back after.

**UPDATE 3**: Back after lunch and I've transcribed his responses to all of the other remaining questions. I'm finishing up now because my grandfather is getting tired (he's already coughing a little bit after talking so much). I'm sorry if we were unable to answer all your questions! My grandfather thanks you all and I want to thank the r/india mods for helping me organize this AMA and the r/india community for making it a success. I've wanted to collect his thoughts and experiences from those years and this AMA really helped me do that well. Thank you all again!",2016-08-04 02:13:24

As an MP, I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A of the IT Act, which was struck down earlier this year.


I believe that the current debate on Net Neutrality is a result of the failure of our previous Governments r to initiate a robust multi-stakeholder discussion on Internet Governance  model based structure for Internet Governance. For over three years now, I have argued that we must strive to create a multi-stakeholder based model for Internet Governance,  which would have also resulted in a conclusion and debate of Net neutrality.

I'm a journalist/blogger, an entrepreneur, an activist (and a failed short story writer). Quick note on some of the stuff I've done: I started on 1st August 2006 with a site that hardly anyone remembers now, called ContentSutra, at a time when no one would give me a job. This was a year when Reliance Entertainment launched Zapak, Sulekha raised $10M and Rajshri was the first to make a movie available for online download. I've easily outlasted NDTV Blogs (which was my first story) and BigAdda (I broke that story). I started MediaNama.com in June 2008, so I also have context on running a media business, and doing events. Apart from that, I began participating in policy discussions (depositions include ecommerce in India, paid news, net neutrality, opening up MVAS. Submissions also include copyright bill). I've written extensively about curbs on free speech, and eventually brought a whole bunch of people together to launch SaveTheInternet.in.

"Hi /r/India, I’m Shankar. I’m an out Indian gay man living in Chennai. Ask me anything!",216,AMA,shankarganesh91,2b7pz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2b7pz6/hi_rindia_im_shankar_im_an_out_indian_gay_man/,322,1405898469.0,"I’m Shankar and I’m 22 years old. I came out publicly on Facebook in December 2013, a couple of weeks after the Supreme Court verdict reinstating Section 377. I graduated in June 2013, and I was out to about twenty friends in college even before I posted on Facebook. I told my Dad when I was in third year of college, and my sister, a few months before I came out on Facebook. 

Life has been a roller-coaster ride so far: it wouldn’t be an understatement to say I felt suicidal multiple times a week when I was in college (not because I couldn’t accept I was gay - I had always known, but because of a couple of other experiences that are a direct result of being gay), but since coming out publicly, I’ve managed to be a lot more happier and confident. I feel much less stressful than I used to, and I cannot even imagine how I managed to be in the closet for that long. 

I lived for 18 years in Tuticorin (a small coastal town south of Tamil Nadu). Before joining work at a tech startup in Chennai, I did my engineering in another Tier 2 town. 

If it matters: almost all of my best friends are straight. I’ve never been harshly discriminated against (no one has come up to me and told me I suck because I'm gay) but I’ve mostly felt like an outsider in college and school, and even today, I sometimes do (despite the fact that it might seem like I’m having it lucky).

A couple of links that can help you get a better idea of my life so far:

[My about.me profile](http://www.about.me/shankarganesh)

[My coming out post](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/coming-out-6f6a6c2f1139) (I deleted this from Facebook because I was depressed again a few months after coming out - I had a copy in my email thankfully, which I later posted to Medium) 

I’ve also written about life as a [gay teenager in India](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/being-a-gay-teenager-in-india-91e8ea58463), and [how I dealt with my depression and suicidal thoughts](http://orinam.net/dealt-depression-suicidal-thoughts/). 

The first step to equality is visibility. Talking about sexual orientation and gender identity is step #0 to securing gay rights. And that isn’t happening in India like in the US. There aren’t many out people, there aren’t many out celebrities (not that they have an obligation to come out), so I’m doing my tiny bit by being open about these topics today here. I’ll be here for an hour so feel free to shoot your questions!

**EDIT 1: I'll be around till midnight. Ask away!**

**EDIT 2: Loving the questions. Staying longer.**

**EDIT 3: I'm done. Thanks, everyone!**

If you need to talk to me, I'm on Twitter: [@_shankarganesh](http://www.twitter.com/_shankarganesh). 

If you're gay, bisexual or trans, and if you're feeling lonely or alienated or suicidal, remember: we're around. The only reason I did this AMA is for you. There are resources, you just need to look for them. Here's a start: [It Gets Better](http://www.itgetsbetter.org). And [Orinam](http://www.orinam.net).

Stay strong, we'll get there somehow: 377 will be gone, and one day your kids wouldn't have to think twice about having two moms or two dads or <insert other gender identities here>.

See you! :)

I am Vahishta. In Dec 2012 I quit my job and sold my house and began planning the rest of my life as a traveler. I spent six months of 2013 in the US, backpacking from the East coast to the West coast. I saw some crazy shit, in terms of mind-bendingly beautiful landscapes, amazing cities and incredible people. And the food. Oh good lord, the food. You may have heard of me via my [blog](http://www.vahishta.com), or my [column in Mumbai Mirror](http://www.mumbaimirror.com/others/leisure/The-first-step/articleshow/20612506.cms) (which, I believe is also syndicated elsewhere in India.)

Ask me anything! Some common questions are: how I financed this adventure, what I do now, what my plans are next, stupid / mad stuff I did / saw...

I'm going to Europe next, for around three months (hopefully! Fingers crossed! Visas are always iffy!) so you can ask me about that too! 

Proof that this is really me: http://imgur.com/jo7pwFX 

BTW this brings up an important question: I'm not sure how to prove I went where I did - I have pictures of the places I went to, but I'm not in most of them. Just take my word for it, ok? :)

If you want more food for discussion, here are some pictures I took while traveling: http://imgur.com/a/axmsJ

PS: Yes, I know the time says 2.30 PM on the stickied frontpage post, but I was excited (and also I read the email from the mod who invited me to do this wrong, so here I am. Dealwithit.jpg)

PPS: How to make me incredibly happy: Ask lots of questions, be inspired, go traveling yourself, meet me on the road for a beer somewhere!

You can subscribe by typing your email address into the form on the right hand side of my blog. It says 'Subscribe', so you know what to look for!)

I have also been a member with various organizations such as WIPO arbitration and mediation center panel of neutrals, ICANN, ASSOCHAM, CII and FICCI. As my bit towards the contribution to the evolving jurisprudence of cyberlaw, I have written around 75 books on various aspects of cyber law and am a regular on the lecture circuit with around 1200 appearances. 

I believe there exists a strong need for awareness amongst Indians regarding cyber laws, especially in this time of a growing surge in internet users in the country, and an even stronger need for reform in the current cyber laws in order to further our national goals as also to secure the rights of our people with respect to **Data Privacy, Electronic Evidence, Cyber Warfare, Virtual & Augmented Reality, Net Neutrality, Darknet, Internet of Things, Blockchain and Bitcoins among other things.**

I'm a bit nervous doing this since I'm not famous or have done anything significantly noteworthy, but I did get asked a few times to do an AMA so here goes!

Here's a brief synopsis of my life, and you can ask me whatever you wish to ask from a phase of life. Proof can be provided as needed :)

I was born in a middle class family in Punjab. I was always one of those kids who was shit in sports and good in studies. I was always a 90+ student. Till the time I took PCM. Fuck.That.Shit. I gave up on studying for Indian examinations and gave the SATs and IELTS so I could try for universities abroad. I got decent scores in my foreign examinations and while I was planning on applying to universities in Canada(I'm punjabi), I heard of this university in China and I said ""hey! let's do something different"". My dad had some work relations in China too, and that helped me solidify the decision.

**China:** I dread thinking about my time back there because of how much I miss that place. China is a heaven for those willing to experiment, explore and immerse themselves in an odd culture. It's equally tough for those looking for ""an easy time abroad"". I spent 4 years of my undergrad at the [University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.edu.cn/). Its one of the top 100 unis in the world with a campus in China. It's relatively expensive, but affordable by the Western standards. I didn't want to take too much money from my parents, so they used to pay for my tuition + accomodation, and I took care of my living+ overheads for the most part in the following ways

* Part time teacher/model(LOL)

* Middleman/agent for my friends looking for jobs

* Bootlegging

* Reselling / pawning old discarded dorm stuff

In China, I learned the bliss that is to travel. Ive travelled almost everywhere in China, and a fair few places apart from that. My travel time in Vietnam changed me, and I honestly regard that trip for making me who I am today. 

**Right now**

I'm working with my family. We have a well established business and I love work, though I hate my city. Been back in India for 6 months now. [I aquascape!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mekcn/askindia_i_have_a_unique_skill_and_a_strange/) and I am on reddit way more than I should be.

What started as a facebook page for planning and discussing local difficulties has now snowballed into a movement supported by more than 33000 Research Scholars with a reach of more than 400,000 people. We believe in peaceful protests and have organised silent marchs, organized street plays, managed Human-Chains and mobilized our supporters to trend hashtags on Twitter to gain attention of authorities.

The felloships across India are funded by different funding bodies, DBT-DST already annouced their notification and are disbursing the fellowships, ICMR followed in Feb'15 and last night MHRD released its notification. Other funding bodies such as CSIR are yet to release any notification. There are still inconsistencies between notifications issued by different authorities. There are other hardships students across the country face - such as getting irregular disbursement of scholarships. Some students get paid only once a year with payments prededucted and we end up not having control over our own money. We are still working towards getting our demands met.

**The AMA is now live (1800 IST)! I've included information about Slum Soccer and the Homeless World Cup below for your reference.**

**About Slum Soccer:**
Slum Soccer is a multiple award winning Sport4Development organization that uses football as a tool for the social upliftment of downtrodden demographics and at-risk youth. We work with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics, slum dwellers, street children, juvenile delinquents, and children of commercial sex workers. With more than 8000 at-risk youth enrolled in 37 centers across India, Slum Soccer has gone from strength to strength in the last 15 years.

We have specific programs tailored around the medium of football that focus on matters ranging from literacy and gender equality to de-addiction and natural resource management. We also conduct a wide range of football tournaments at local, state, and national level throughout the year in order to provide our charges with the football exposure their talent and tenacity deserves. We have been the Official Indian Partner to the Homeless World Cup for 10 years now, and have proudly borne witness to Team India's rise through the global rankings. The men's team now stands at rank 31 and the women's team at rank 5 - both all-time highs.

**About Homeless World Cup (HWC):**
Founded by Mel Young and Harald Schmied in 2001, the Homeless World Cup is an annual football tournament that advocates for a global solution to homelessness and helps its participants untie the social albatrosses on their necks. With partners in more than 70 countries, the competition touches the lives of 100,000 homeless people every year through experience sharing and an infusion of respect and importance that their lives have lacked so far.

Here is an old but still relevant video about the Homeless World Cup and Team India's rising popularity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5AURAansuA

**Homeless World Cup Glasgow 2016:**

Isn't it just fucking great how companies like Ola valued at around USD 10 Billion desperately needs donations from people like us to pay their drivers wages amounting to 30cr?,261,Business/Finance,voodoodopetrain,fw14l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw14l3/isnt_it_just_fucking_great_how_companies_like_ola/,93,1586217117.0,"And I know that a lot of upper management in the company has donated  (total amounting to 20cr.)  It still doesn't make any sense that the larger part of the Fund had to be crowdfunded when the company could take care of the whole amount and more while barely taking a hit.

Retaining your employees in times of crisis is the responsibility of the employer and Ola is more than equipped to deal with such a situation. This means what they are doing is simultaneously putting the pressure on their customers TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES SALARY while acting like caring, charitable employers.

And don't even talk about the CEO forgoing an entire year of his salary. When you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country , this gesture looks a lot more like what it actually is: cheap PR bullshit. And let's not forget after forgoing his salary for a year his net worth remains at around 3100 crore.

"Finance Basics – Share Market,Mutual fund, Insurance",71,Business/Finance,vikashred,fxb9zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxb9zh/finance_basics_share_marketmutual_fund_insurance/,34,1586397416.0,"Lets learn something being at home. Any doubts you can message me.

If you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

The real thing now is – why we need to invest. It’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That’s called inflation.

So, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

So, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

We will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1. Share Market –
I just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

Just search in google : reliance share price

At that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

Company list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

The broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

For example zerodha, they are India’s largest share broker -




They are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. Mutual Fund :
Mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

They are of different types:

i. Equity Mutual fund:

Equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
There are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.
A index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

If someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. Debt fund:
Debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.

iii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

For a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

There are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their coin.zerodha.com to trade mutual funds. It’s free and direct.
You can sign up and use the app to buy. It’s easy.

You may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3. Insurance :
Insurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. General insurance
General insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like

First party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

Third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
These are compulsory in india.

ii. Life insurance

Life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. Health Insurance:
Health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. Term Insurance:
Term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…

But only death benefit, else you won’t get money.

c. Endowment Plans:

If you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

Or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.

You get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

Basically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . Health insurance is a must though.",2020-04-09 07:26:56

We would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (PART RANT),82,Business/Finance,abbawaddadu,fupeo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fupeo0/we_would_have_gone_into_a_recession_regardless_of/,21,1586014075.0,"People seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",2020-04-04 20:57:55

PSA: Don't opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don't do it for your credit cards,122,Business/Finance,ChelshireGoose,ftybqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftybqp/psa_dont_opt_for_the_3month_moratorium_unless_you/,23,1585903576.0,"I see a lot of misinformation floating around about the RBI moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, I guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  
     
When you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is ₹20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ₹60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ₹1L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      

Credit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ₹1L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ₹1,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, I'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.",2020-04-03 14:16:16

ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,7,Business/Finance,DheerajKochhar,fxmvof,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,15,1586440394.0,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

This will be my first job in India and I have some very basic questions:

I am a bit confused on some of the allowances in the offer breakdown - I have been offered a base salary and along with that I get house rent allowance, special allowance, vehicle reimbursement and internet allowance.

1. For house allowance - do I have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? Or do I have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? Does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?
2. Do I have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?
3. How do I claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?

Basically trying to understand how much I can expect to get as a salary deposit in my account

A dialogue for Indians to understand why bitcoin even exists,11,Business/Finance,freewheelin_zee,fo4779,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fo4779/a_dialogue_for_indians_to_understand_why_bitcoin/,9,1585081237.0,"**TL;DR Owner of a bank or financial institute can change the amount of money in the financial system (modern money is just a number in the banks database), while manipulation of this nature is impossible on block chain**

**Given the current Indian financial market situation me and a friend had this dialogue to try and understand if bitcoin is of any use to us.. may be it helps you start a conversation with someone else and get a better understanding of things.**  

I’m a stock market trader and recently I was talking to this friend of mine who is into bitcoin as  well as the stock market.. 

He asked me if I knew why bitcoin was needed in this world.. 

And my answer was.. An alternate currency

Turns out it’s got an actual reason for existing

**BTC is an alternative to fiat currency? or “store of value” like how Gold is?**

But Bitcoin is not like Gold at all. 

* Gold is valuable as a metal. 
* It is soft, malleable, 
* very good conductor of electricity, 
* safe to the skin unlike copper and does not tarnish over time. 
* If we needed gold in large quantities and cost wasn’t a problem, we can actually create gold in particle accelerators. So it's not a matter of gold being scarce

**Bitcoin has no physical value like gold. Bitcoin is all digital.**

&#x200B;

**A Simple Though experiment:**

Let’s assume I open a bank called DVZ bank and people have deposited a total of Rs.1,000 with my bank. 

* Now people and corporations come to me asking for loans and I give them a combined loan of Rs. 10,000. 

Where did the extra Rs.9,000 come from? 

You decide whether this is a problem or not for a financial system.

**As it turns out, in the modern world, money is just a number in a bank's software. It can be tweaked any way the controlling authorities want.**

As an authority, without a few people in my pocket, I  could set up a XYZ business just for the purpose of creating money. XYZ business would never make a single rupee in profit but we will keep adding new money into the XYZs bank account every month. It's our bank. Our software. Our database. Who is to stop us? 

Whereas Blockchain is a self-regulating database. 

**Once an entry is made into the blockchain, it can not be edited without destroying the whole database. It maintains integrity by nature.** 

**So, if 21 Million bitcoins are coded into the database, it cannot ever become 22 Million Bitcoins. Whereas in any other currency or banking platform it can be changed.** 

Banks are based on ledgers that can be manipulated by the bank owners and governing parties. 

Bitcoin runs on blockchain ledgers which are immutable.

To break this down ever further, let’s say you have 100 rupees in Paytm Wallet and Paytm’s core developer is your best friend. You can convince him to turn that 100 into 10,000. This cannot be done with Bitcoin, if that is done, the whole database breaks.

Has this ever happened? Paytm has been accused of internal fraud by audit companies multiple times. A Famous incident that can be quickly searched online is where an ex paytm employee created fake transactions in order to earn from cashbacks. Total fraud of over 10Cr. 

The loans given out in Bitcoins will be real bitcoins and not fake money which eventually turns into real money. Banks give out money that they don’t have and don't recover, that leaves a hole in the financial system.

Blockchain is attempting to provide a very clean and efficient financial system, to have a record of what’s coming in and what’s going out. If implemented successfully, we will do away with printing money and bringing in Helicopter money during times like these. It will all be a zero-sum game then.

Your thoughts in comments please (we are figuring this out through a dialogue so please be constructive with the comments, in a way that we learn a thing a two from your comments too)

**NEGATIVES OF BLOCK CHAIN/BITCOIN** 

We came across some negatives for bitcoin too.

If Country has Trillion $ economy.. and it gets burned..by some natural calamity or some other factor

no problem, govt will pump in another trillion into existence and live on.

but if i have million bitcoins and lose the key

It’s gone forever. no chance of ever recovering it",2020-03-25 01:50:37
A perspective about business that will help you in investment,3,Business/Finance,vikashred,fyk6e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fyk6e8/a_perspective_about_business_that_will_help_you/,6,1586568175.0,"Let me give you some perspective of business that will help you identify shares.

When i started a company, it was hard for me to figure out , i used to campaign on my own, later i learnt ,i just have to get more people to work ,and keep getting more campaigns at higher prices.

Now,i just have to focus on two things, people and campaigns. If i have to expand my business ,i have to just increase  both . There is no such innovation needed , innovation just comes on the way. So ,the formula is so simple,you just have to focus on sales and your products. Just try to increase it . And there is no such innovation  needed to expand. You have just do more work , if you are making sales ,do more sales,making something ,keeping making more.

If the share you are purchasing, are not expanding that means they are just not doing the same work more and more ,on which their business is based on. It means they are not focused.

Take a 5 year horizon ,so if they are focused, a year is a long time ,they should increase year on year. They have to just do the same thing more and more. Its so simple. So ,if a business is not expanding , and cannot do that simple thing ,why will you ever invest in it.",2020-04-11 06:52:55

Okay, now here's the story, My dad passed away last November and since then it has been a problem to maintain our bills, and it certainly doesn't help that we are under a big home loan, which my dad and mom took couple of years ago, and wasn't able to pay because my father lost his job then, he did try to get a job now and then... And he manage to earn some money to help with the loan, and mine and my sisters study.. my mom also used to work 2 shifts (9-10 hours) 2 different jobs... 

But now the situation after my dad passed away is..

- I m a student grade 12,
- And my mom only works one job in the morning, because she isn't comfortable anymore..

- my mom's salary is less than the amount we should be paying for the loan per month

- he didn't have any life insurance
- the money my mom earns, goes into helping with bills, maintainance, etc. My school fees

- I do have my grandparents with ample amount of money to help us, but for what ever reason they aren't helping right now, it could be the fact if he helps with such an high amount, the members in the family might expect him to divide his wealth next, And I personally don't want that kind of strain in our family.. so we aren't pushing that idea home..

-And the problem is not the home loan, but the other loan we took from different banks to pay are existing loans, (bad decision, i know)

Anyways what i want to know is, that if their is any way we could be helped in this situation, with any law or a program launched by government of some sorts, i just need financial advice on what should be the next step, so their is not a lot of burden on my mom... 

I will be glad to have any help🙏😔

As these big traders have huge fan following on various social media platforms so when they shared their market analysis many small retail traders followed them and got trapped.

This is post is just to warn small retail traders who blindly follow big traders and try to copy them. The experienced and seasoned traders have their risks calculated behind every trade they enter into and even if the trade goes wrong they have firefighting skills in order to exit at breakeven or with minimum losses.

I would say that instead of blindly following others spend time in enhancing your trading skills and observe live charts daily to sense the market moves on your own. When you know the reason behind a trade entry then you will be more confident about it instead of taking a trade posted by someone else.

I am also a retail trader just like everyone else out there. But I trade based on my analysis and to give you yesterday's example my analysis was saying there will be correction at the market opening and thus exactly at 9.17 AM I posted below tweet from my Twitter account.

Moreover, at around 9.43 AM I was bearish on the market and had published another tweet related to #banknifty futures which is as follows.

**What did market do after this ?**

\#BankNifty futures faced resistance 3 times from the exact same level (21057) which was posted well in advance and corrected more than 1300 points from there.

This post is just to motivate small retail traders that you can be independent when it comes to analysing the markets. You just need to put in good efforts to attain right knowledge.

This is my first post on reddit and I don't know how it works out here.  Keep learning.

"Company not paying salary since last 7 months, What can be done?",16,Business/Finance,hellomotor254,fw9fm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw9fm8/company_not_paying_salary_since_last_7_months/,2,1586244369.0,"My dad is working for a construction company since last 11 years, everything was going well until last year when the company started facing financial crunch.

Since then, the company is not paying salary to much of it's employees since last 8 months, my dad was planning on to shift to another company then covid 19 striked and prospects of landing a new job looks bleak as of now.

With so much money stuck our family is facing severe financial hardships and even managing our living expenses is now difficult, along with psychological impacts. 
Enough of backstory.

I wanted to know what we can do to get the unpaid dues (about 7 months of salary, allowances and reimbursements) from the company, what are the legal options available for us.
I will not name the company but it's well reputed in construction industry and a small-cap.",2020-04-07 12:56:09
"COVID-19 , Business, Impacts and Recession",14,Business/Finance,sardikhasi,flqirb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/flqirb/covid19_business_impacts_and_recession/,7,1584716189.0,"COVID-19 is a global catastrophe right now. Something we took very lightly in the initial stage as a country, as individuals and as business.

But this hit us in a very unexpected way. Malls which were crowded all the times, are shut. Public transport are running almost empty. 
Everything is so silent outside that you can feel the air is clean. You can actually hear the birds singing. If you pay attention, In cities you can see more stars at night these days. Well, nature has its own way to clear the dirt. 

But we are humans, lets just be mean and think from our perspective. Within a week, the offices are empty. small businesses gave their employees work from home. Big companies are following 50% occupancy rule.

For some time i want you guys to think emotionally and be logical. The scene is bigger than the virus. 

**We are not heading for a recession, we are heading towards depression.**

IT companies who were working on projects which are almost 80% complete. Just have those projects in their hand. which will pay them not more than 25% of the final amount of the proposal.

Projects which were about to start, Have shut, Projects which were between 35-70% completion, are paused. And there are no new projects.

Constructions and real estate sectors in cities have stopped for next 6 months. Big companies, have circulated the mail to small vendors that there won't be any money coming for atleast next 6 months. (Cement, steel, rocks and bricks provider, architects, etc etc) who work on a month or 3 month money rotation, and mind you, even the smallest vendor work for not less than 10 lacks rotation, got no money. These guys are in immediate debts. 

Manufacturing is yet to hit, coz people are still buying stuff. But this will stop in a month. 

Coming back to, people dont have projects to work and money to rotate. They (we) are having funds to sustain our staff for 6 months. But, this works when the world is fine and we don't have projects.
the case is different here. The world is burning and we can see that businesses are not going to get any thing for next 1 year minimum. So this is not the time to think about employees, but to save the company and the investment. 
Employee class is going to get the salary of april. that's it. that's the fact.

Learn it, love it, live it. Byheart it. write it on a paper and stick to the wall, get up and read this everyday. prepare yourself. 

Do not enjoy this time as you are working from home. Use this time to think. Plan your actions, cut your expenses. if you have savings for 6 months, make sure you use it for a year.

Unfortunately, this catastrophe is an opportunity for big companies to layoff thousands of their non-performing employees (NPE). the number will be as big as 60%.
and for small businesses, 80% (small businesses usually dont have NPE, every employee is an asset but its directly proportional to the company's turnover and number of projects).

so lets just take a rough number that almost around 40% - 50% people are loosing their jobs in june-july.

But people who earn daily wages, have started feeling the impact right now. 

Constructions would stop, killing the daily wages of construction workers. Spending capacity will reduce, killing semi luxury utilities like cab/auto, restaurants , travel. 

Do not expect any compensation from government, And for country's good, please dont! 

Country needs money to run. Hospitals, food, maintaining law and order, may be camps, these will suck a lot of money from govt locker.
So don't expect any lone wavers, tax exemptions, bill exemptions or reducing petrol price coz its down world wide.
Yes we can argue that the banks gave loan to some individuals and they ran away and potato potato. What's gone is gone. 
if the government works in our favour, its good. But dont keep any hope.

This week took businesses atleast 6 months back. and in coming days, we are going to loose almost 2-3 years of hardwork and buildup. 

Days are going to be hard. This is not the post to scare people. I dont care about the upvotes or downvotes. 

I feel bad when i see people enjoying work from home. I saw people who were asked by companies 'Office will be shut, you cant take your systems home, if you have laptops, we will install the required softwares to your system and you can continue working'
and people straight away said 'NO' to that.
For your information, Business remembers everything, Thats how business evolves. And business is an entity without heart. 
You guys are the first one the companies gonna layoff. 

Last but not the least, while I was planning, I jotted down a lot of points but while writing, i'm sure I missed a lot. Please feel free to ask any questions you have. 
Please feel free to suggest any actions which can be implemented which will help both the business and employees.",2020-03-20 20:26:29
Is this a good deal?,6,Business/Finance,haphazardwizardofoz,fxpcir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxpcir/is_this_a_good_deal/,3,1586452983.0,"Hey guys.
Hope you're staying safe in these troubled times. 
It's probably not the right time to ask questions like the one I'm going to ask now but I really need your help. 
So here's the scene. 

I've just finished my undergrad degree and have been approached by a startup to be a co-founder. Basically, it's a startup in the legaltech industry and they want someone with both legal and tech experience to take the company forward. 

It's two years old and is incubated by one of the leading law firms in the country. This firm is mentoring and guiding the team and the team is looking to raise its first funding round come September. 

Upon speaking to the founder, I found him to be quite passionate and hardworking. We have been on call a few times since then, and we have exchanged business ideas and strategies about the marketplace and the future of the startup. 

Here's a rough idea of the deal I'm getting offered. 
He's offering me an equity stake in the company. (The valuation or the percent stake is not crystallized yet but is negotiable). 
My rent and meals will also be taken care of. Transport cost is negligible as the place is situated close to the incubator. 
In addition, I've asked him that I would like to draw a salary as well for my miscellaneous personal expenditure (Sutta, daaru etc) 
This startup is based out of Delhi. 

What I want to know is this a good deal? I've spoken to a few people in the startup scene and have gotten mixed reviews although the majority want me to go ahead and take this gig. 

I do want to join this startup. It offers me responsibility, and I'm reading and learning about my job everyday and its super fun. 

What I'm confused about is the deal that I'll strike with them. How much equity stake should I ask for? How much salary should I ask? ( They're bootstrapped and living off of cash prizes won off several hackathons). 
Any other questions which might be pertinent to ask? so that all formalities are taken care off and I can start work at the earliest. 

Please help out a brother in need!

1) what are you general thoughts about these platforms?
2) how much are they contributing to society? Do you view it as a good, noble initiative or people behind these are putting up a philanthropic front to make money?
3) where are they lacking? What could they do better as they are far behind international players like Kickstarter etc
4) what changes would you make to these platforms?
5) what makes you trust/not trust these platforms?
6) have you had a personal experience with them as a donor or as someone raising funds? How was the experience?

I'm being extorted to pay 33k more because I booked a room at Lalit Goa during NYE 😭,145,Business/Finance,sithzkrieg,eei17j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eei17j/im_being_extorted_to_pay_33k_more_because_i/,101,1577119555.0,"Shocked by the Lalit!  They collected 25k for room booking in Goa for NY eve and later casually informed me of 'mandatory gala dinner' for which I have to pay 33k extra.

Now they're refusing to allow me to stay without the dinner and refusing to refund my booking. Heartbroken that Lalit would stoop so low as to cheat guests with fine print and trickery.

I made the booking cos it's my lil sister's first new years in India and I wanted it to be special! But now instead of the 25k I've saved up it's 58k which there's NO WAY I can afford. I'm literally in tears. This is more than my monthly expenses and I have no idea what to do. They've got me in a choke hold. If I cancel, I lose 25 k and I will have to book another hotel which at such short notice will be exorbitant. The alternative is worse. Stay and pay the 33 k which is simply not an option. 

What should I do? I feel so helpless. Breaks my heart that this special occasion that we've been looking forward to and saving up for has been ruined by corporate greed 😭 

TL;DR: booked room for 25k for two days, got hit with 33k hidden cost for 1 mandatory NYE dinner.

EDIT: thanks for the overwhelming support and excellent advice. Thanks to y'all I've started recording all calls and maintaining records of communication with them. 
Updates and Clarifications:
1. We're two females travelling alone and my sister is a child/minor so I saved up for the Lalit for safety reasons as well as wanting to make her first indian new year special
2. I booked through Agoda using my debit card. Many people have pointed out this should have been done through credit card but I don't have one. 
3. Agoda customer service were sympathetic but said Lalit have to approve the refund and they're refusing to do so.
4. Lalit manager called and let it slip that many other customers are unhappy and in the same boat but Lalit policy is that they can't refund. Tried to put the blame on Agoda but when I said I'd spoken to Agoda and they were happy to initiate cancellation, he didn't say much apart from ehm Well according to policy we can't do this bla bla. 
4. Put the incident on Instagram story and tagged both lalit group and Keshav Suri, one of the more insta savvy and seemingly fair Lalit bosses. No response so far.

Edit 2:
Got a message on insta from lalitgroup who said their manager will call me. Waiting for the call and will update once it happens. 

Edit 3: 
All sorted! They agreed the messaging was unclear but blamed Agoda for the listing. Nevertheless after posting on insta, social media team contacted me, the Lalit Goa got in touch and offered me a discount on the gala dinner of up to 50%. I still couldn't afford 17/18k for a dinner so insisted on a full refund instead which they finally agreed to. Agoda were supportive and immediately agreed to process the refund but said it might take up to 30 days to credit the refund back into my bank account. Fingers crossed but looks like it's all sorted now. 
Thanks sooo much for the outpouring of support and advice. Can't thank y'all enough <3 was so lost and thanks to the advice on this sub, this was resolved within 5 days. You guys are the best",2019-12-23 22:15:55

Beware Guys - UPI Phishing scam,108,Business/Finance,salute2vishal,eqisqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eqisqq/beware_guys_upi_phishing_scam/,28,1579395206.0,"Hi Guys,

Couple of days ago my sister law got scammed by UPI phishing, I heard this type of scam for the first time.

She wanted to send courier through blue-dart, she searched the customer care contact number of bluedart through google.  She called the number appearing on the first search (first mistake).  The guy told her that o collect the courier she needs to forward an sms to a number and to fill a google form sent her through link.  They forwarded her an sms containing alphanumeric next and she forwarded it to the number she was told (second mistake).  Then she filled up the google form mentioning her name and UPI ID (I think she might have also included UPI PIN) (third mistake).  

At night time around 2 am, series of sms came and around 37k of money got deducted from her three bank accounts.  She didnt have UPI linked to her YES bank account, that also they linked and deducted money from that.

From the first mistake, it can be realized that scamsters are using google ads for using their contact numbers to be shown as customer numbers for legit business like bluedart, fedex , swiggy etc.

Second mistake : I am not sure why they asked her to forward the weird alphanumeric sms to some number.  As per my understanding you need physical sim card present in your phone for UPI app to detect and register your number with your bank account, might be they are using this sms to clone your SIM number some how.  I didnt understand the usage of forwarding the sms to a number.

Third mistake :  This was a rookie mistake to give your UPI id and might be also along with it UPI PIN to strangers

So guys please beware of this scam , when you search on google about contacts numbers for some business , please make sure don't click on the ads shown by Google.  As you have got the contact number from Google you think the person on the other side of the phone is genuine which makes things easier for scamster.",2020-01-19 06:23:26

RESTAURANT UPDATE-HOW TO SURVIVE & WIN AFTER LOCK-DOWN ENDS?,5,Business/Finance,apaiserconsult,fuf4z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuf4z2/restaurant_updatehow_to_survive_win_after/,0,1585972184.0," 

As per the article in [Businesstoday.in](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-impact-50-restaurants-to-shutdown-if-lockdown-extends-till-may/story/399903.html) which is regarding the restaurant survival during the lock-down period in India it is said that:

**50% restaurants to shut if lockdown extends; Zomato, Swiggy business down 10% :** Only 5-6 restaurant chains have enough cash reserves to sustain more than a month, the sector will need government's help if there's no improvement after May.

Well, their is always a brighter side of the story! and this lockdown period can well utilized for all the research and development for the new market. Yes! you read it correct, it is going to be a fresh and new market, for you and your current restaurant too. So what does a new comer in the market does? What pre-launch preparation he does ? What he wants to boast about before and after the launch? 

Lemme tell you if you want to survive in this new market once this Covid-19 lockdown in India is over, you have to work upon one and only ONE thing and it is your RE-BRANDING & MARKETING! Yes, people must NOT forget your name from the market! and people must know what you are going to offer after the market is open. Obviously you are going to bank upon takeaway orders initially for few weeks or can be a month or two! Now when you know about this right now, then you can always cut short your staffing according to the needs of a take-away joint. Service guys can be asked to work on stipends for a month or can be motivated for the salary in coming month in part payments. Good ones will stay with you! Don't worry. 

DO NOT worry about staffing for next few months at-least, because their will be plenty of manpower available, filtered out from those restaurants who did not survived the impact. A great possibility of salary negotiation too. 

Work upon the ZERO waste menu. Do some research, ZERO waste menu is something where the only food waste is the stuff which once cannot digest or is toxic/not recommended to eat. For planned ZERO waste menu you may contact here and you might get some professional help if needed. 

Get a nice air purifier and alkaline water purifier if possible. Why? well apart from the health benefits, this thing is going to help you a lot in your re-launch event, how? We gonna talk in points mentioned below in a while. Their are hotel grades version for kitchen and guest area as cheap as 40k . 

Try to arrange your in-house delivery guy, so that you can save upon the commissions from Swiggy & Zomato, as their will be good number of delivery orders, saving upon the commission can save you your one month electricity bill for sure! Will tell you the ways to promote your own contact .

NOW: All is set you have done all of the above mentioned points, asked your landlord to waive off your rent and luckily he agreed! :) 

Its 10 days left now before lockdown gets over, what next? 

BOOST YOUR INTERNET / INSTAGRAM / YOUTUBE / FACEBOOK WITH ALL THE ENERGY YOU GOT! 

Now its time to hit hard with a well planned hospitality grade digital marketing campaign which is going to make your customers and as well as the potentially new customers about the things you have got for them once the market is open.

Its time to showcase your new ZERO waste menu with cool offers, you are going to shout about the healthy environment your outlet is going to offer to your staff as well as the people who walk in, you are going to boast about the alkaline way of cooking meals, you are going to boast about all the reasons you have for your existing customers as well as new customers to visit. 

A WELL PLANNED DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TAILORED FOR HOTEL AND RESTAURANT NEEDS IS AN ONLY WAY WHICH CAN HELP YOU GET OUT OF THIS MESS AND HELP YOU SURVIVE THE CRASH.  

WHEN HIRING ANY DIGITAL MEDIA EXPERT, ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF HOTEL/RESTAURANT OR F&B SECTOR. Why? Because if they know the 01s of F&B industry then they will be able to target your clients, menu promotions, promotions of your other food services easily. You just need to tell them WHAT YOU WANT. Rest you can leave all upon them, the deals, promo etc too, remember the points mentioned above, and don't worry! Situation is all fine, what is required ? a bit of creativity and vision.

Unpopular Opinion: Piyush Goyal is right about Amazon and calling it out on it's shitty tax avoidance policies,46,Business/Finance,ShadySingh,epvrj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/epvrj1/unpopular_opinion_piyush_goyal_is_right_about/,25,1579266152.0,"I know there are currently widespread protests across India regarding the Citizenship Amendment, but let us not paint every statement & action of the government as 'terrible' without debating it first.

Amazon, alongwith the other tech giants Google, Facebook, Microsoft have mastered the art of Tax Avoidance and shifting profits offshore.

Amazon itself has destroyed Book stores, mom & pop stores and other small businesses in the US. Only mega corporations like Walmart, Target etc can compete with them in the offline sphere.

They have a history of shitty labor practices. Employees being forced to pee in bottles in order to meet quotas, delivery drivers being overworked to death.

And on top of that, Amazon looks for special privileges and Tax Incentives when deciding for new Headquarters, Offices & fulfillment centers. They know they have a monopoly in the online marketplace and abuse that fact to strong arm local goverments to give them special tax incentives, resulting in loss of state & federal taxes.

I'm sure there are other factors too (plastic waste, shady sellers and fake products etc) which someone more knowledgeable than me can hopefully explain better

I know this government has done a lot of shitty things during the past 5+ years, but calling out Bezos is not one of them. I'm glad that our ministers are not sucking up to him and having his already massive ego stroked even more",2020-01-17 18:32:32

He said his seniors are looking for someone to join their business and I am the first one who came to his mind. I thought it would be unwise to say no without even looking at the opportunity, so I said yes I would meet this senior. Now I knew he invested in some business and was quite busy and kept telling us that he's learning a lot and it's once in a lifetime opportunity, so clearly I was excited to be a part of such business. So I go to Starbucks to a mall nearby with A to meet this senior guy, let's call him VK. While I was waiting with A, he kept talking about how awesome VK is, and how much I am going to enjoy talking with him. So this guy VK comes and I meet him starts with some chitchat. After some chitchat he asks me 3 things:-

* Do I have capital or am I willing to take a loan (approx. 3-5 lakhs INR)?  
I said yes, I do have capital.
* Will I consult with someone before investing?  
I said yes I will consult my friend AM before investing as he's quite knowledgeable and I trust him.  
Then VK tries to convince me that I shouldn't because most will tell me what they've ""heard"" and might not be in my best interested.
* Why do I want to do a business?  
<Some legit reason>

Now he started telling me some stuff from business books and being a guy from technical background all that fascinated me. After a lot of business lecture he comes on what this company Qnet does. He said they have some exclusive products, they've been there for 22 years, they sponsor some football club etc. etc. and to enter this business I have to buy a product and sell it to 2 of my friends and the moment he drew a tree I knew it's a pyramid scheme but I also knew A is not idiot, he would've invested after thinking (I assumed as he is from IIT Roorkee and I knew him since 8 months) so I kept on listening thinking there might be some catch and all. During all this discussion he kept asking why I want to do a business, most probably to make me feel that this is the moment that can change my life. He starts showing off how close his mentor is to him and how everyone helps out each other and his mentor have a big house and they hang out with her and have fun etc. etc. After this he starts showing me calculations how I am going to be a rich in an year. After this he said I should invest in this business, it would be better if I do it on a loan as it will be the motivation and kept on pushing me that I should atleast lock my position now as if someone else comes before me they will get more commission then me ( a classic impulse selling technique ). They pushed me multiple times  to lock the position (which I considered as red flag) but I subtly declined (subtle as I live with A and don't want to make things awkward by being rude to the people matter to him).  So I came home started doing some research and found out a case is running in supreme court, high court declared them illegal and their original website is blocked by GOI. Supreme court gave bail to the people arrested so Qnet will use that as selling point. Dodged a bullet here. I would love to know if you have crossed your path with this entity and how was your experience.

I have been in home isolation for a while and today went out to buy groceries and random food products. To my surprise some shopkeepers (not many) are selling basic items like biscuits, maggi, lays, etc at price higher than MRP. The price increase is about Rs.4 to Rs.6, which is not much but I don't like the fact that they are taking advantage of the crises and people needs. 

These items not necessarily comes under essential goods but I think its still not right. When I ask about it they get easily agitated saying ""lena hai to lo ya jao"" and reasons like high demand are the replies.

I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion.

Do Indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?,20,Food,earnestpotter,g07a97,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g07a97/do_indian_restaurants_actually_use_yeast_to/,7,1586763183.0,"Short version:

A  naan's crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer,  it is almost hollow in the middle, no bready glutenous structures,  image for reference: [https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg)   This makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal, so a phulka like internal structure, but with tandoor's heat you'd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip, actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that?

Long version:

I'm  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  India, which I believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. While most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. I've seen   restaurants in European countries also do this, so I guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg)

Going  back to naans in India however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

The   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  The more I'm  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more I'm feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. Does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual Indian restaurants? Most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb   to naan, while I'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. I experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don't have atta) , so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ](https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ) ,

So   I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?

Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,686,Food,VelvetHedgehog,eogkmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,343,1579006550.0,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",2020-01-14 18:25:50

So I had a discussion with someone really cool about things we wanted to do post normalcy and he suggested I could make a list. So here goes.

1. Since most of my friends are restaurant owners, I want to go meet EVERYONE. I want to hug everyone I've known in the outside world and if I meet people I've had a falling out with, I'll hug them too. Our problems are nothing. I really hope everyone makes it.
2. Things I've taken for granted and really want to eat again.   
a)CHOCOLATE FUCKING CAKE. I'M BUYING ATLEAST A KILO AND THE MESSAGE IS GONNA BE MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS.   
b) Mithai!!! If I knew things would escalate so quickly, I really would have stocked up. The only stock I have right now is of smokes and chocolates.   
c) Samosa, and although Vada Pav makes me sick, I'm gonna eat that anyway. I miss it.  
d) Pizza, burgers, fries, even coca cola(I'm anti anything by that company but now I'm desperate for some junk food) you name it.  
e) Icecream!  
f) Shawarma. oh my god I miss this terribly. 
3. Things I want to drink- I don't really drink but when I do, I'm a spiced rum and coke person (thank you Cambodia) BUT that being said, I definitely am going to buy myself some beer.
4. Things I want to do- Go trekking! I believe nature will be so amazing this time with barely any pollution. 
5. I also really want to go out on a long ride on my bike. Right now my bike trips are limited to buying smokes (which ends in 5 mins) and I definitely need to go out more.
6. Go for long walks, road trips, picnics, you name it. I'm not a ""religious institution"" person, but I'll do that too.
7. Go watch any movie in a theater.
8. Ride a local train. I miss the crowds.
9. Probably you. (Sorry just thought this was funny)

No jokes, I think the list could be longer but this sums up the main things I really wanna do. If any of you around would like to join me for any or all of these things, feel free to send me a message! We'll talk and keep in touch and whenever the chaos ends and the sun's shine is truly warm, a one that brings happiness, we'll hang out.

Tho we had a lot of people who've lived across the middle east for ages refrained from introducing it with the fear that it wouldn't match the Indian tastebuds. Fortunately the agitation ended. The introduction of shawarma gave an astounding response here. It took time to gain leverage but once it picked up the demand shot. 

Shawarma and mandi in most areas are not like how they taste in the middle east. It took a pioneering turn to customise and infuse it with the power of indian spices raising the bar to a much larger degree.

Condoms are not sexy. Condom ads should not be sexy either.

But unfortunately, when it comes to food industry, the word ""natural"" is very vague. See  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_foods)

Recently I took a liking for peanut butter. I liked it very much. But I had eaten the sugar-free variety which someone got me from abroad. I prefer that. I looked everywhere in retail stores for unsweetened natural peanut butter without added sugar or added salt, vegetable oils. I couldn't find. All of the peanut butter on sale was heavily processed with added sugar, salt, emulsifiers, vegetable oils.

So I turned to Amazon India for buying unsweetened peanut butter. And luckily I found several brands selling peanut butter without added sugar, oils etc. Since then I have successfully been ordering unsweetened peanut butter on a regular basis from Amazon India. It's not I don't know to look at the ingredients. However a recent experience made me lose trust in Amazon India. After searching for unsweetened peanut butter, I came across a product labeled **ALL NATURAL** PEANUT BUTTER from a same brand as the previously ordered unsweetened variety.

I looked at the product packaging and description and it was the same as the unsweetened product I had purchased several times previously. I was in a hurry for work so I purchased it (quite a number of bottles in fact as I buy it in bulk). However it turned out be peanut butter with added sugar and salt. It turns out I had missed seeing 1 small line in 1 particular image out of 5-6 images. That line listed sugar, salt in fine print. All the rest of the description, labels, packaging was exactly the same as the unsweetened variety and the title which said ALL NATURAL (which is why I got it).

I approached Amazon India to give me a refund (food products like this are non-returnable) as I am very weight conscious, having lost 50 kg after childhood obesity, and I cannot have peanut butter with added sugar+salt in it. I explained to them that it was a bulk order and that most of the bottles were intact, sealed, unopened and refrigerated but it was not the product I wanted and I had been misled into buying it. They refused the refund, blamed me for not paying attention to the fine print and basically said they can't do anything and that I should approach the manufacturer.

I contacted the manufacturer (whom I will not name to protect their identity). They admitted that the varieties of peanut butter they had - unsweetened and processed had similar packaging except for that ingredients line. But what they told me about Amazon was a revelation. They informed me that AMAZON INDIA had taken over all of the marketing and sales of their brand of peanut butter. So they were only now a company responsible for manufacturing it and supplying it to Amazon, NOT for the marketing and how it's advertised. Also, the bottle itself only contains the word Natural but for the Sweetened variety, Amazon made it ALL NATURAL (whereas the *unsweetened* variety is actually just ""Natural"" - go figure).

Regardless, the manufacturing company admitted the packaging was similar enough to confuse anyone and it wasn't my fault especially since it was labeled ALL NATURAL. The manufacturer was kind enough to give me a replacement for the peanut butter. But this is a lesson to learn. Amazon in this case is not merely the seller of the product. They are responsible for the marketing too, as confirmed to me by the manufacturer and despite this, they refuse to bear responsibility for deceptively marketing it by selling it as ALL NATURAL. I contacted their support multiple times via chat, phone, Twitter and every time they refused to take responsibility.

So just be very careful while buying peanut butter from Amazon Retail or Pantry. Also, I will be taking this issue to Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) who can prohibit Amazon from selling such falsely marketed products. (Processed food sold as ALL NATURAL). BUYER BEWARE. In this case, since retail stores were not carrying unsweetened peanut butter, I had to turn to Amazon. But they screwed me like this.

Now, the peanut butter from this particular brand comes in fact in 3 varieties, not just 2. They are all marketed by Amazon confusingly:

\#1 ""**All** Natural Peanut Butter (Sweetened)"" - is clear that it has added sugar in it

\#2 ""Unsweetened Natural Peanut Butter"" (Notice no ""ALL"" in the marketing - could also imply it has not been sweetened but is not ALL natural - can still contain unhealthy vegetable oils or salt or emulsifiers - some brands add these things so the oil doesn't separate from the crushed peanuts, but for this brand, it contains pure peanuts and nothing else)

\#3 ""**All** Natural Peanut Butter"" (without the word Sweetened but which also actually contains added sugar+salt so the extent that it tastes considerably sweet) - Note how since #1 exists and is marked as Sweetened and #3 does not carry that label, one would assume this to be devoid of separately added sugar especially if #2 is not listed at all on the same page. I'll admit that I should have looked at the ingredients like I usually always do but I ordered it in a hurry, having had a good experience with this brand earlier 3-4 times and because I didn't expect the packaging of all varieties to be exactly the same!

Amazon has modified the description on the bottle for marketing reasons as the manufacturer revealed. The actual product packaging/label on the bottle only says Natural Creamy or Natural Crunchy, in which case I would still go hunting for the ingredients and see if sugar is added. But All Natural meant without sugar to me (a hard lesson learned now) at least especially when the other is explicitly marked Sweetened (I didn't even know there were 3 varieties, 6 actually if you consider Crunchy vs Creamy - all with SAME packaging). And now Amazon absolve all responsibility.

**Update**: What's worse is that I am even seeing listings on Amazon where they are selling a TWO PACK jar peanut butter with both jars in different colors. Ingredients listed for only 1 jar which has no added sugar while the jar of other color has added sugar but ingredients of that bottle \*not listed in the 2 pack listing\*; only where that other colored jar is listed separately for purchase it shows that it has added sugar, palm oil, canola oil etc. So again, people looking at the ingredients in the 2 pack listing will order it having verified that one of the jars is free of added-sugar and after getting it realize the other jar had added sugar in it.

**Update 2**: To make things worse, the replacement bottles were delivered in an unusable condition. Due to poor packaging which caused spillage, they were coated with peanut butter completely:

[https://i.imgur.com/RzLWctf.png](https://i.imgur.com/RzLWctf.png)

Due to such a bad experience, I have decided to make the brand name public anyway. It's **GOURMET DELICACY** peanut butter.

**Update 3**: The Nutrition label seems to be completely wrong as ALL THREE VARIETIES list the same amount of sugar despite two containing added sugar and tasting significantly sweet. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️",2019-10-09 22:50:17

Brew gear: inverted aeropress, occasionally a Turkish pot. Don't have a thermometer or scales or other jazz. I use a flush scoop of the aeropress spoon; let 500 ml of water boil in an electric kettle and dump anything between 150-250 ml of room-temperature water into it before pouring.

Budget and space are not really a problem, but functionality is.

Currently I am planning to get two ovens - a combi-steam oven and a pyrolitic oven.

However I am confused. Do I need both? The pyrolitic oven can reach higher temperatures than the steam oven.

Also, I am concerned that the standard built-in oven is 60cm in size, and I am having a bit of trouble finding a bigger model without spending stupid sums on a Wolf oven.

Should I get a range like Bertazzoni/La Germania or Elica instead? Those will come with much larger ovens.

Will they reach the same 300C temperatures that a built-in oven can reach?",2019-10-25 07:12:22

1) Follow the proportions as mentioned on the wrapper
2) Add about 1 Tbsp of olive oil into the pan 
3) Add cold water and boil it
4) While the water is boiling, add the Maggi cluster(s) - I can't think of any other word
5) Cook for 2 mins - not any more!
6) Pour out the excess amount of water ( leave some in though, depending on how you like it )
7) Add the masala, mix well, cover the pan and cook on low heat for 2 mins
8) Enjoy

I'm at a point where I have rented a small place (I'm alone here) in Hyderabad, and might be here for a while.

I have never made anything except tea/coffee/Maggi, and I really wanna learn to cook *nutritious food* . Trying to start slow and learn 9-10 good dishes so that I can keep Swiggy usage to a minimum. Preferably without a pressure cooker, but I'm open to getting one *later*.

Foods -
Vegetarian food, eggs, and chicken

Tools - 
1. 1 induction heater
2. Something similar to this set - Prestige Omega Special Pack (3 Piece BYK Set, Both Gas Stove & Induction Compatible) https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07SPZS1HL/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_yf9rDbTVD8NCE
3. The regular spatulas, spoons, etc.

Trying not to buy a pressure cooker right now. If I can make something decent and if I remain in Hyderabad for some months, will get one later.

Tentative ideas so far (just asking family and guessing) - 

1. Omelette
2. Spinach with some bell peppers
3. Carrots and beans sabzi
4. Bhindi with onions
5. Mixing bell peppers with some scrambled eggs?? (Is this even a legit dish?)
6. Poha with onions, tomatoes, and groundnuts

So my question is to those who use an RO, how would you compare the water quality when it comes to bottled mineral water? And factoring in maintenance etc., is it a better option than buying Aquafina/Bisleri every week?

Pleasantly surprised with the amount of sports Hotstar is making available.,133,Sports,SreesanthTakesIt,dvrc4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dvrc4w/pleasantly_surprised_with_the_amount_of_sports/,35,1573678405.0,"Hotstar is currently streaming U17 Women's Football Tigresses vs Panthers match. Why it's surprising that this match is being streamed:

* It's not cricket. Non-cricket sports have generally not been broadcast unless super important
* It's women's game. Great to see women's matches being broadcast.
* It's U17. It's not even the top level side.
* It's a domestic match. It's not some FIFA WC Qualifier.

Other than that, more domestic cricket matches are being streamed now. Today a few SMA trophy matches were streamed and an U19 match vs Nepal was streamed.

Hockey Olympic qualifiers were also streamed, for both men and women.

Pro Kabaddi has obviously had a lot of success too.

I don't follow other sports much, but a few badminton opens were also streamed AFAIK.",2019-11-14 02:23:25

Timing of Dhoni's stint with the army and Amrapali group Sham leak,684,Sports,tchme_sensei,chze6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/chze6i/timing_of_dhonis_stint_with_the_army_and_amrapali/,129,1564151961.0,"Just going through the news and following cricket, I would like to put forth a timeline of events to bring about an unbiased conclusion, so here goes the timeline

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above). 

- Meanwhile the match starts on Aug3 and we all go India...India with ads of Dream 11 and Godaddy after every over, khelo dimag se my friends",2019-07-26 20:09:21

My assessment on Indian Olympics contingent,16,Sports,gauravxm,d7lsqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d7lsqd/my_assessment_on_indian_olympics_contingent/,13,1569155785.0,"I was very excited about India's chances at Rio Olympics but sadly we were very unlucky there. I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders.",2019-09-22 18:06:25

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India.

Fuck all Religion,17834,Politics,pking3,f9outu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,4206,1582726249.0,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Thanks to Modi ji I will now find out who are the intelligent people in my locality by looking at whether their lights are on.

Meanwhile, a day earlier on 19th, Gujarat-based firm CoSara had already received an approval to start manufacturing Covid-19 test kits. This firm is a collaboration between a US-based company & an Ahmedabad-based firm.

CoSara's kits already have US FDA approval.

Some of the other 18 firms who were waiting to get their Covid-19 test kits validated said that these would be sold at a price of 400-500 per kit (far cheaper than imported ones). 

CoSara, on the other hand, refused to publicly divulge the cost of their Covid-19 kits.

Suddenly, on 21st March, the Health Ministry issued guidelines allowing private labs to conduct Covid-19 tests. The cost of these is capped at a whopping 4500 rupees.

These guidelines have one caveat - ONLY testing kits approved by US FDA/European CE can be used.

That means ONLY kits manufactured by Ahmedabad-based CoSara can be used for Covid-19 testing.

So after allowing 18 firms to test their kits for production, the Modi govt. suddenly changed guidelines to favor ONLY 1 Ahmedabad company (whose testing kit cost is unknown).

Why is a Gujarat-based firm being provided a monopoly on Covid-19 testing kits by suddenly tweaking guidelines overnight?

Why are 18 firms who can produce testing kits for very cheap prices being blocked by these sudden new guidelines?

Update: Now the health ministry in its press conference today has said, that US FDA and EU CE approval aren't mandatory. So, now Roche and CoSara are two companies who have the nod from them to manufacture and sell test kits. But the question remains why they haven't validated others as well. Either reject their application or accept it, why sit on it when test kits are badly needed.

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

"During lockdown, Uttarakhand CM (on Amit Shah's orders) arranged 28 buses to transport 1800 Gujarati devotees stranded in Haridwar back to Ahmedabad. Uttarakhand workers in Ahmedabad were then duped of Rs. 18000 and stranded midway when they tried to use these buses to return home.",689,Politics,rahulthewall,fu7wnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu7wnt/during_lockdown_uttarakhand_cm_on_amit_shahs/,43,1585947272.0,"Link to the story: https://www.bhaskar.com/db-original/news/amit-shah-vijay-rupani-latest-updates-on-gujarat-pilgrims-return-from-haridwar-rishikesh-over-coronavirus-lockdown-127094521.html

Since the story is in Hindi, here's a summary of the events as reported by Dainik Bhaskar

>गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार ने एक न्यूज एजेंसी को बताया- ‘गुजरात के अलग-अलग जिलों के करीब 1800 लोग हरिद्वार में फंसे हुए थे। केंद्रीय मंत्री मनसुखभाई मांडविया और मुख्यमंत्री विजय रूपाणी के विशेष प्रयासों से इन लोगों को वहां से निकालकर इनके घर पहुंचाने की व्यवस्था की गई।’ इसी व्यवस्था के चलते उत्तराखंड परिवहन की कई गाड़ियां हरिद्वार से अहमदाबाद पहुंची थी। दिलचस्प है कि ये काम इतनी गोपनीयता से किया गया कि उत्तराखंड के परिवहन मंत्री तक को ये खबर नहीं लगी कि उनके विभाग की कई गाड़ियां लॉकडाउन के दौरान कई राज्यों की सीमाओं को पार करते हुए 1200 किलोमीटर के सफर पर निकल चुकी हैं।

Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - ""Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

>27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।

An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**

Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. 

>मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’

Mukesh Kumar says- ""The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '

>मुकेश और उनके साथियों को उत्तराखंड परिवहन की इन बसों ने अहमदाबाद से बैठा तो लिया लेकिन उत्तराखंड पहुंचने से पहले ही रात के अंधेरे में किसी को राजस्थान तो किसी को हरियाणा में ही उतार दिया। 

Instead of Uttarakhand, these buses dropped Mukesh and his companions midway. Some were dropped off in Harayana, and some in Rajasthan. 


> बताया जा रहा है कि गुजरात के ये तमाम लोग किसी धार्मिक अनुष्ठान में शामिल होने हरिद्वार पहुंचे थे। प्रधानमंत्री और गृह मंत्री के अपने प्रदेश से आए इन लोगों को उनका करीबी भी बताया जा रहा है। गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार के आधिकारिक बयान से भी इतना तो साफ होता ही है कि जहां देशभर में लाखों लोग यहां-वहां फंसे हुए हैं, वहीं हरिद्वार में फंसे इन लोगों को सीधा गृह मंत्री के निजी हस्तक्षेप के बाद विशेष व्यवस्था करके निकाला गया है।

It is being said that all these people from Gujarat had reached Haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**

>दूसरी तरफ मुकेश कुमार जैसे लोग है, जिन्होंने अपने प्रदेश की गाड़ियों को आता देख अपने घर लौट पाने की उम्मीद पाली थी, लेकिन वो अब तक भी अधर में लटके हुए हैं।

On the other hand there are people like Mukesh Kumar, who had expected to be able to return to their homes after seeing the buses coming from their state, but they have been stranded.

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Had to get this off my chest, sorry, and thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

If you have any objections to what i have said, i can conversate or debate sanely but please stop the craziness, use your brains i don't care what your parents, uncle aunties believe in, use your own brains otherwise India is not gonna stay a democratic country, and this is not even a baseless fact anymore, it's all around us, we just close our eyes to look around.",2020-04-05 02:28:28

What do you do when your own family subscribes to the ‘goli maaro’ ideology?

During the lockdown I was visiting my parents. We live in a large joint family setting. Now my every morning starts with Hindu Muslim hate speech as newspapers (Hindi) are read and tv news channels are put on loud. Of course they haven’t even subscribed to any remotely sane news channel. I isolate myself in a small room at the back of the house to get away from it but the shrill voice of frothing at the mouth anchors permeates everything. 
What’s worse is that after being fed their daily dose of toxicity, family members discuss it all day with glee. They call up other distant relatives and say stuff like “TJ ke bare mein suna apne? Gaddar hain ye log. Modi ji ko inhe chodna nahi chahiye. Inka ek hi ilaaj hai. Line mein khada karke goli maaro sabko”
Since yesterday, when news broke of some guy getting shot for saying TJ is behind coronavirus in India, they are targeting me with sarcastic and laced with toxicity pseudo-debates. Pseudo because they don’t really want to engage in discussion, they only want to humiliate me for my views. Maybe they secretly think I’m a gaddar too. 
I’m desperate to get out of this house and get back to my own home (another city) but I cannot till lockdown is lifted. Now it seems that it may not happen on 14th as planned earlier. I’m feeling so trapped and it’s disturbing my mental peace. I don’t know how to deal with so much toxicity and hate everyday day after day.

>Prime Minister of India 

>Dear Prime Minister, I would like to convey to you my solidarity along with that of millions of Congress party workers at this time of immense humanitarian crisis. We are all doing our utmost to cooperate with the steps the government is taking to fight the Coronavirus outbreak in India. 

>The world has been forced to take immediate, severe measures to contain the rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus and India is currently in the midst of a three-week lockdown. I must urge you to seriously consider the potentially devastating impact a nationwide lockdown would have on our people, our society and our economy. 

>It is critical for us to understand that India's conditions are unique. We may be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy. The number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for us to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from the Covid-19 virus. 

>It is important that the government consider a more nuanced and targeted approach that takes the complex realities of our people into consideration. Our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of their proximity to older people.

> Millions of India’s elderly live in villages. A complete lockdown and the resulting shut down of our economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents, grandparents and the elderly population. This will result in a catastrophic loss of life. 

>We must immediately strengthen the social safety net and use every public resource we have to support and shelter the working poor. The financial package announced by the government is a good first step. But speedy delivery of the package is important. Please announce and enforce a clear roadmap with dates for its implementation. Large population centres will require equally large, dedicated hospitals with thousands of beds and ventilators. It is critical that we start setting up these structures and manufacturing the necessary equipment as fast as is humanly possible. At the same time, we need to dramatically increase the number of tests that we are carrying out and get an accurate picture of the virus’s spread in order to contain it. 

>The government’s sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion. Thousands of migrant workers have been forced to leave their rented homes as they are unable to pay rent. It is important that the government intervenes and provide them money for their rent immediately. Factories, small industries and construction sites have closed, tens of thousands of migrant labourers are trying to walk to their villages and are stranded at various state borders. They are rendered totally vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services. They are struggling to seek refuge as they march to reach far-away homes. It is important that we help them find shelter and inject money directly into their bank accounts to help them survive these arduous next few months. 

>It is also critical that we set up a defensive wall around our key financial and strategic institutions to protect them from the shock wave that is bound to come as the true impact of the virus and our economic shutdown hits us a few weeks from now. Our informal economy and immense network of small and medium businesses and farmers are going to be vital to any rebuilding effort. It is crucial that we engage them in a conversation, build their confidence and protect their interests with correct and timely action. 

>We stand together with the government in fighting and overcoming this tremendous challenge. 

>With best wishes, Rahul Gandhi

From 2002 to 2019- Member of Parliament 

From 2004 to 2014- Central Minister 

Since last 6 years -Not Minister because congress in not in power

Since last Year- Not MP, Because he lost an election. 

So have can you say that Congress haven't given anything to Scindia.

He supported abrogation of Art 370 & didn't stand firm with his party's opinion along lines of democratic morals.

He couldn't survive 1 year without power. Surviving without position and power is an important trait of leadership. Some who lack ideology can't survive without it even for one year.

Scindia only has about 20 MLAs with him while Kamal Nath has over 90 MLAs supporting him. Why should Scindia have been made a CM over Kamal Nath.

The INC is the party of corruption and dynasts.

Now there are attacks on Muslims in the name of cow protection but those are just isolated incidents. Jayant Sinha, one of the suave US educated faces garlands them but, after all, they haven't been convicted.

Then comes demonetization but it didn't affect you. So what if it dropped the GDP by 2 points; they meant well, it has laid the foundation for our prosperity. GST came along and, sure a few (many) people complained because it was tough for small business, but it is a great idea and it would be churlish to point out that implementation is part of a government's responsibility.

Then came the ED/CBI raids but clearly those raided were guilty and it is just a coincidence that only opponents were targeted. The EC makes decisions that somehow always favor the BJP but we are used to that. Important statistics are hidden but we don't trust statistics anyway and Amitabh Kant tells us that everything is fine.

Now come the elections and you vote for the BJP again because Rahul. Doesn't matter that Sadhvi, Tejasvi and Ananthkumar Hegde are standing. Doesn't matter that the bigotry extends up to the top, it's an election and the goal is to win the election.

We pass over 370 because why should we care what the Kashmiris think? They will be better off in the long run even if we have to turn the state into a prison for a year. And the students should be focusing on their studies. Admittedly, they were in the library when the police stormed in but students have to understand that we are paying for their education.

Now comes CAA but it doesn't apply to citizens and even if it mentions every religion except Islam, it is a positive measure because we should welcome refugees. Even though Amit Shah laid out the timeline, NRC has not yet been notified and so why should we worry about something that has not been notified yet. Let CAA go and then we'll make sure that no citizen is affected. It's not clear yet how we identify citizens (or perhaps it is clear) but we will make sure that no citizen is affected. After all, Modi and Shah have assured us that no one has to be worried.

Now come the riots in Delhi but there was clearly violence on both sides. Alright more Muslim businesses and homes were burnt but they have to learn that we voted this government in and they can't hold up a parliamentary democracy by protesting, even if they are peaceful.

So my question is: Is there any point at which you look in the mirror and say enough is enough?

Holy fuck there is so much hatred and bigotry. Kapil Mishra the violent fanatic who started the riots and unleashed his extremist mobs to murder people has raised over 90 Lakhs but for Hindu victims only. Most of the victims of HIS mobs were Muslims but no such funds for them.,358,Politics,SimpleClearCrisp,fl5mg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl5mg7/holy_fuck_there_is_so_much_hatred_and_bigotry/,54,1584629706.0,"According to the death  toll around 60-75% of victims are Muslims but they will get nothing from this. 

But people are donating for only one group and the campaign is being run by the violent terrorist who should be in jail. He is the scumbag who unleashed the mobs and now he has become the superstar. 

People are just lying and creating 100% fake news about how Muslim victim groups are getting money from ""Khan Market"" or whatever nonsense and so they will not give a single rupee to the Muslim victims of Kapil Mishra's Sanghi death squads. 

For example here. These two justifications for this are popular but based on complete lies. Of course Hindu Nationalists have no problem with lies. 

>While Muslim victims are being paid from Govt. treasure through Waqf board, there is nothing for Hindus. Great job Kapil Bhai.

>Salute sir is working for those poor souls who lost everything in #DelhiRiots & won’t get anything from #khanMarket funding

This is so enraging. The worst thing is complete lies they are making up that the Muslim victims don't need help because they will be taken of by the ""secular"" or whatever when this is not happening at all. And the man who started the riots directly has faced no consequences and is being treated as a savour. 

Imagine in America if someone was to crowdfund for ""white victims only"" in a riot where mostly black people died. 

The right wing in India is so much more openly monstrous and blood thirsty.

How deep does the hatred for Muslims go in Indian society?,269,Politics,Pessimist-Indian,fbvox4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbvox4/how_deep_does_the_hatred_for_muslims_go_in_indian/,175,1583106022.0,"Met a hindu friend yesterday who runs a business in a small-town that has decent Muslim population (\~20%). He told me all the good things about how he has close Muslim friends. How he COMPULSARILY has to visit 3 of his friend's house for feast during Eid. How when he was looking for partners to play Badminton, most hindu groups didn't take him in but the Muslim guys welcomed him with open arms. How he is welcome into their homes where other men cannot go, (meaning they consider like a family member). So when he told me all this, I expected he will have empathy towards the sufferings of the Muslims since he is close to so many. 

But as you'd have guessed by now, he was a Modi supporter with strong distrust towards Muslims. Although he claimed he is not against them (proof that he has so many close Muslim friends) but he felt they are extremely fanatic (kattar). I kept asking have they ever forced you or anyone to do anything against their wish. If not how can they be fanatic. Whatever their problems it is within their community. He strongly believes Muslims have 'enjoyed' the appeasement politics for many years and got so many benefits. How they want to have 4-5 kids to increase their population. He felt all Muslims should have gone to Pakistan during partition. You know, the usual stuff.

If this is how someone who has close Muslim friends thinks, then what can we say about the majority who have very little connection with Muslims. Every day, every conversation just goes onto solidify my belief that it is impossible to overcome this hate. We will either go the Germany way or the Israel way. Either way the future is not looking good.

This divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites.

With the coronavirus further slowing down an already relatively slow economy and increasing an already high unemployment rate, such misinformation will definitely cause more riots (or worse, a civil war).

The ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor. During the Delhi riots, most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor. They will only further suffer if such misinformation that causes communal tensions are spread.

To the people who have read this post till now, if you see anybody in WhatsApp or any other social media site posting any misinformation or fake news, I implore you to call them out for spreading such misinformation and tell them that it is ILLEGAL AND PUNISHABLE if they further do so. Whether you are respectful to them or not is at your own discretion. If they still don't stop then report them to the concerned authority.

As tens of lakhs of Indians tuned in to their news channels/Twitter today at 9 am, we heard the leader of our nation ask us to light candles at 9 pm on Sunday.

In a time where medical professionals are being attacked by patients & their kin, where medical professionals are quite vocally expressing their need for PPEs, where people are clearly still flouting outside, the leader called this a successful operation & that the next step is to light a candle?

In a time where we see cases of migrants who passed away while walking hundreds of kilometers home, where in a city like Mumbai, there is still no proper arrangement to deliver essentials to residents, the leader wants us to stand tall at 9 pm.

And shortly after the speech, the IT cell went into overdrive & within a few minutes we recieved WhatsApp forwards stating how this 9 pm candle light will rid India of COVID-19. And there is no effort or modicum of effort from the authorities to dispel these fake forwards.

I am genuinely scared that people will take this as an opportunity to come out & do bonfires/candlelight marches, and what not.

Credit where it is due, the lockdown was needed. But, so was the planning. In a time where the world's eyes are upon India and Bloomberg put out an article that shows that India failed it's citizens, the world scrutiny is even more.

Should the leader have addressed points like:

- increasing testing (especially in areas like the Dharavi slums of Mumbai that can become a cluster in no time)?

- PPEs for medical professionals?

- urging people to keep medical professionals in regard & to respect them?

- held a call with top Virologists & Doctors instead of top 40 cricketers?

USA, September, 2001:

11th September, 2001 upended the world as we knew it. My parents and I, like so many others, were left broken. Anyone who looked different was now the new enemy. Muslims and Sikhs were suddenly perceived as the enemy and no one deserved that. 

As a woman of the Hindu-Sikh origin, I took it upon myself to teach people that not everybody is an enemy. We all just happened to look alike. 

India, March, 2020:

A man child called me Pakistani because I told him to get in queue at a grocery store. I hurt his ego and he, an Indian citizen (I assume) called another Indian citizen, Pakistani, as if it’s sufficient humiliation.

In return, the only thing I said to offset his comment was, “Yes, if I have the audacity and decency to respect other people’s time and effort, I am a Pakistani.”

India has given me endless freedom and countless rights. 

It’s the intolerance that I don’t have a right to. Nobody does. Not even you.

Today, I am a Pakistani, living in Mumbai, India. 

Tomorrow, I may be a Muslim, living in Mumbai, India. 

After this, I may be a Christian, living in Mumbai, India. 

Soon, all of humanity will be me. These are the people I will become. These are the faces I will fight for.",2020-03-05 05:12:23

Do not get too invested in any of these to the point that you suspend disbelief and let it consume your identity. You are more than just one thought or ideology. 

Your unconditional support to these makes you nothing more than a loyal servant. A useful idiot.

I know those words are harsh but there is no softer way of saying it.

By unconditionally supporting your dear leader, the favorite actor or the ideology that you believe in you let it consume your complex character and become this monotonous set of programmed reaction. 

You become part of the herd that follows its Shepard off the cliff. The rats that follow the piper down to death.

Did you know that you can show your support while at the same time critically looking at things based on their merits?

If you cannot invest your critical thinking, then at least don’t dismiss who took the effort of doing so just because it goes against your herd. Doing so might feel like a victory in the short run but it will set you up for failure since you are not receptive to feedback. After all how strong is your belief in those things when it can’t even stand the test of opposing arguments and ridicule? How robust is an argument which cannot stand cross examination? If you want your ideology or your fandom to sustain then learn from those systems and institutions which did sustain for years. They are all open to criticism and evolve consistently based on  feedback.

I know it must be very comforting and happy when you feel part of a tribe however distant and imaginary your role in it is. 
But there are also the negative aspects such as the ego death and identity collapse when these ideologies eventually fail the test of reason and argument. 

So be brave to stand apart in the crowd. Don’t let your stage fright get you.

Be smart in where you invest your support. Don’t let the piper sing you down the cliff.

Be safe and protect yourself from accidentally giving too much of yourself for something or someone without being open to criticism. 

It will only lead to ridicule, shame and regret.

P.S. - This is just a PSA based on my personal experience. Obviously this doesn’t apply to every kind of loyal supporter but, mostly to those who conflate their identities so much that it leads to mental and physical harm to themselves and others.

A friend in a WhatsApp group chat dug himself into a hole while defending police brutality in India,140,Politics,abhilash1991,ft0wah,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ft0wah/a_friend_in_a_whatsapp_group_chat_dug_himself/,19,1585780462.0,"Thought I would share this amusing instance from yesterday. I usually try to stay away from these conflicts as I've lost a friend in the past due to political differences. But this was too much, so had to speak up.

Someone shared a clip of a policeman mistakenly beating someone else just because he was wearing the same shirt as the guy the cop was chasing. This friend stated that he deserves the beating as he was outside as well.

I tried to talk some sense into him, stating that he could be out to buy essentials, and we shouldn't judge without evidence, but the friend was adamant. A long debate followed, where he blatantly refused to acknowledge all of my points that included a lady doctor being slapped by police in Delhi, a cop hitting a doctor in Tamilnadu and then telling him why didn't he inform him that he was a doctor before he was beaten, and a constable named Rajvir (now suspended) destroying vegetable thelas in Delhi. 

He had two simple answers to my points:

1. Police are standing in 40° outside for us, so we need to support them NO MATTER WHAT.

2. Why didn't I raise my voice on (insert an issue that fits his narrative)

I told him clearly that I support cops as long as they are properly punishing curfew breakers without exercising brutality and sadism on doctors, people going out to buy essentials, zomato delivery boys, poor vendors etc.

An hour after the debate was over, he posted a clip with tons of laughing smileys. The clip showed police stopping a couple and revealing that the pillion rider was a boy who was under burkha (the rider told the police that ""she"" is his cousin, before the reveal. They were hit with the stick lightly before the video ended.

I watched the clip and found out that it was from Pakistan, as could be seen on the licence the boy showed to the cop. I told my friend that this is definitely an offense and the PAKISTANI policemen are doing an incredible job by punishing them. Then I thanked him for sharing the clip so that police from our nation could learn a thing or two from it.

He didn't respond after that. This guy absolutely HATES Pakistan and his FB is filled with anti-Pak and anti-Muslim posts. I wish I could see his face when he realized that he shared a video from Pakistan. His intention was to clearly show us how Indian police are doing a good job on many cases (and they do, I believe not all of them are brutal sadists), but didn't notice that he was unintentionally praising the police of a nation he hates from the bottom of his heart.",2020-04-02 04:04:22

Endlessly refreshing for BigBasket delivery slots? Created a cross-platform program to notify you whenever a delivery slot gets available in your area.,70,Science/Technology,Drazxie,fzzcgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzzcgy/endlessly_refreshing_for_bigbasket_delivery_slots/,19,1586736363.0,"**Live at**: https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier

**Demo**: [Demo](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif?raw=true)

**Detailed Installing Instructions**: [Documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

---
This program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OS X) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid-19: A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



Some of the key features includes:

1. Cross platform system wide notifications.
1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself.
1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. Program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19, I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, However if you have any ideas to improve the section - Feel free to send a PR.

The program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [Github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

""Devendra Ji,

* Our PM Modi is some great man, probably.

I said

""Hey, he is, but what did he do now?""

He said, ""We have been doing research in India for the last 30 years on Infectious Disease, but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind.""

I asked, ""Are you also making fun of Modi like seculars, leftists, Muslims, Thukde Thukde Gang, Urban Naxalites, Award Returning Gangs, AAP, NDTV etc in India?""

He said, ""Oh nothing like that, I and my whole family have been citizens of America for 19 years, My annual salary is more than 15 crores in Indian rupees, But the hearts are still Indian.

Every major step and decision of Modi is completely separated from politics, I wish the welfare of India and human beings I also saw Lakhs of Indians are making fun of Modi's 1 day self-imposed curfew, But in our laboratory, a 45-minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of Modi.

You would be surprised, this 45-minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours, with a 1-day self-imposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on Covid 19 in particular,

All scientists were of the opinion that, 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world, Because Covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body.

In such a situation, being cut off from the outside world, inanimate objects such as door handles, Currency notes, files, courier parcels, Steering wheels of vehicles Viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated, And without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by Modi, Since there is no loss of work due to Sunday,

* The country will be almost free from viruses! * These ideas were not thought of in the minds of the world's highest level scientists of this subject

If any of his advisors has given this advice to Modi then this person is entitled to the Nobel Prize, and if the great idea is the brainchild of Modi, then he should get the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his contribution in the medical field of Infectious Disease. ""*

I could not even speak a word.

There are a couple of things I like here, namely the cheap economy, cheap rent, great housing in newly constructed apartments, great infrastructure with water, gas and electricity.

I'm from a top-tier engineering college and have a decent pay.

Looking for a change in job around start of 2021, and colleagues recommended Bangalore just because it has a lot more opportunities (in the category I'd be looking for) and should be my choice above NCR. Some of them have already been there and mostly came here for their families and advice me so.

Here's what I pay for in Noida -

Rent for 3 BHK (larger living area) - 18000, 6 kms from office, takes 20 minutes to reach in \~150 rupee split among two people per side for uber. Electricity is cheap. Gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes.

[Poor UX of a fairly popular Indian bank's online platform](https://reddit.com/link/ftn4l0/video/feawzp2jfhq41/player)

As seen above, revealing options in select dropdowns requires special tricks. And input fields actually trigger sidebars (or dropdown?) in an already cramped box. Form generally follows function, but seems like the developers at [Finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/corporate-banks/) were more concerned with adding wave effect to the buttons, and slide transition to menus than actually testing their rubbish. I'd give another fifteen instances of atrocious UI, but you get the gist.

If they can't even get the easier parts of writing a web app right, I wonder what sort of nightmare realm exists on the back-end.

There's of course the trend of forcing users to update their passwords every quarter or so. Do you append a number to your password and increment it? Well, most do, which is why it's such a shit form of security, and [advised against by NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05). I feel for the non-tech-savvy folks who are probably writing their passwords down somewhere instead of using a manager. Some banks double down and require separate sign in and transaction passwords, each with its own rules, naturally.

How bout quad-nation aircraft carrier for IOC,14,Science/Technology,ReadwithKartikeya,fuv5y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuv5y8/how_bout_quadnation_aircraft_carrier_for_ioc/,11,1586041454.0,"# How bout a Quad-nation Aircraft Carrier Strike Group?

***By: Kartikeya Semwal***

With the ever-increasing threat posed by China’s PLA Navy in the IOC (Indian Ocean Region), neighbouring countries like Japan, South Korea and Australia have started feeling the need to induct and operate aircraft carriers of their own. Till now, none of these countries has an operational Aircraft Carrier (AC). Instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or ALS (Amphibious Landing Ships).

[INS Vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)

But more than them, India feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 Aircraft Carriers (ACs). Currently, Indian Navy has a solo AC called INS Vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from Russia. By 2022, India will get its 2nd AC which is its own indigenous AC called INS Vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. Now since India has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 AC fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. 

[India's Indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)

Guarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe Pakistan doesn’t have an AC of its own. Opposite to that, China currently has 2 ACs namely Laoning & Shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. With this, China’s power projection through it’s PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India. China is working on getting 2 more ACs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of IOC. Till date, IOC has been guarded by India Navy in coordination with Japanese & South Korean Navy. 

[PLA Navy AC Shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)

Indian Navy’s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of PLA Navy & to effectively guard the IOC region, it needs a 3rd AC which if accepted by Govt. of India (GOI); will be India’s 2nd indigenous AC called INS Vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. Due to this reason, GOI is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd AC for Indian Navy.

[India-Australia Navy Officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)

But there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an AC jointly by 4 nations namely India, Australia, Japan & South Korea. Indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. This will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. I am hereby sharing the following points about it:-It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

1. Having a joint AC will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. 

2. It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

3. Each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as Japan for its electrical & electronic parts, Australia and South Korea for their weapon packages & crew and India for its expertise in hull & designing. 

4. Since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best AC built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. 

5. A huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. 

6. Joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 South Asian countries. That will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. 

7. Automatic threat-neutralisation from China’s PLA Navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint AC as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies.

One point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. Now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as Lockheed Martin’s F-35Bs or the 4+ generation Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Now except India, all 3 countries have already ordered F-35As for their airforce’ modernization plans. So they can easily get the F-35Bs which have been specially designed to be operated from ACs. 

But again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint AC which in-turn won’t be feasible. Add to it, while the other 3 countries are also NATO members, US won’t be willing to allow access of F-35Bs with Indian navy officers & sailors on the AC as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of F-35Bs, which they might share with IAF, DRDO & HAL to help them make their own 5th generation AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft).

On the other hand, opting for F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. The US won’t mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to Indian Navy and Indian Airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. Indian Navy’s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of Super Hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts.

Now it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the Chinese threat in IOC. It is only a matter of time coz once if PLA Navy gets its 3rd AC possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. But if India, Japan, Australia and South Korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint AC & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then China would think twice before messing with it.",2020-04-05 04:34:14

I should have worked hard in my 11th and 12th and cleared JEE, I admit. There is no good education in India outside of the IITs and only handful other elite institutes. I was a bright student in primary school and had big dreams and high expectations. But something happened after 10th and it all went downhill there on.

I am a first year undergrad studying physics in a shitty university. I love physics and I hope to have a good career in the field. But going to college only demotivates me. It is a colossal waste of time. The teachers are all stupid who very likely bought their PhDs. They don’t even know the basics. I am forced to put up with their bullsh\*t everyday, goddammit. Every lecture feels like a torture. I am an honest, sincere and a hardworking student (not bragging) and I don’t deserve what is happening to me. I don’t see how I am going to be a good physicist without a good teacher or mentor. 

I am severely depressed and have also thought and almost acted on killing myself. I got no friends and my family can’t really do anything to help me. I can’t change or quit college because 1) it’s too late now, I have already lost one year to depression and poor health 2) it is going to be the same elsewhere too and 3) it is a really bad idea to quit college in India. There is nothing around to keep me motivated. I am thoroughly fed up and feel like running away from here. I am very scared for my future. I need emotional support and I don’t know where to find it.",2020-03-19 01:08:12

If crores of people install it, just using wireless heahphones is enough to track your location.

It picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. So even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

While I see how it will allow them to back days and see whom all an affected patient came in contact with, they also see who all you came in contact with, where you were at a point in time etc.

WHO findings after trip to China - 5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. We Indians are so fucked if this gets here!,40,Science/Technology,Silverballers47,fbxmmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbxmmt/who_findings_after_trip_to_china_5_of_people_who/,17,1583113763.0,"The WHO has sent a team of international experts to China to investigate the situation, including Clifford Lane, Clinical Director at the US National Institutes of Health. Here is the press conference on Youtube and the final report of the commission as PDF after they visited Beijing, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Here are some interesting facts about Covid that I have not yet read in the media:

When a cluster of several infected people occurred in China, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. Transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. Most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.

5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. The duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). The mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in Wuhan many times over. The province of Hubei, whose capital is Wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. A total of 40,000 employees were sent to Hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in Wuhan are caring for Covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. Two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.

China can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. The test delivers a result on the same day. Across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: In Guangdong province, far from Wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.

The vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. Cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.

The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.

An examination of 44,672 infected people in China showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. Fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. All fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in China up to 17 February, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.

Healthcare system: 20% of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response, the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago.

Pre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

Age: The younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:

table placeholder 

Read: Of those infected in China, 8.1% were between 20 and 29 years old (this does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected). Of those infected in this age group, 0.2% died.

Gender: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

The new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. Therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.

Since the end of January, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in China has been steadily declining (shown here as a graph) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. ""This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real,"" the report says. The authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of Chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. Here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment.

One of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that China is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. There are 1,800 teams in Wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. But the effort outside of Wuhan is also big. In Shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. In Sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. In the province of Guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. That means: If you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.

Finally, a few direct quotes from the report:

""China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. China’s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. This rather unique and unprecedented public health response in China reversed the escalating cases in both Hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.""

""Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China. These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.""

""COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.""",2020-03-02 07:19:23

I've gone through a lot of technical details between the roland fp10 and the yamaha p-125 from past month now (quarantining my ass off on this comparisons)  
I know the FP-30 is a better choice but the prices here in india...i think i'll have to sell a kidney to buy the roland. its stupidly high !.  
Roland   FP-30 - goes for RS. 72,824 or $952.96   
Roland   FP-10 - goes for Rs. 59,973 or $784.79  
Yamaha p-125 - goes for Rs. 53,189 or $696.02 

I know the digital sounds can easily be replaced after doing the midi wizardry (im a soft dev so i can handle those technicalities easily later) and by the looks of it both the rolands above have tri sensor keys which will yield much better midi data in case i do decide to swap out the sounds for (post processing? i dont know the right term for this). Thats why i prefer the Rolands for now and ofcourse because of their action (no i haven't tried them yet, because guess what, noone even has them on display here in the entire state).

My Questions  
1 - Yamaha Or Roland - which will age better? (lot of roland youtube videos complaining about loud keynoise after 4-6 months of usage while yamaha has no complains on the same). im planing to use this keyboard untill it fails to work or dies on me 7+ years easily.

2- Is that price tag justifiable for roland? i mean should i pay 100$ + just for the 3 key sensors ? 

3-i want to be able to learn complex arrangements of classical music later on (like Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata (3rd Movement)) which should also be fine on yamaha right?

3- Do the rolands in india have bluetooth connectivity ? most indian sites say ""does not come with bluetooth"" which i sort of need. anyone in india purchased this?

The hardships of creating a completely anonymous account,9,Science/Technology,get-pwned,fhzemo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fhzemo/the_hardships_of_creating_a_completely_anonymous/,14,1584133819.0,"This is just a sharing a recent experience of mine while creating this account of mine. This is a complete anonymous account and it has technically no traces of it back to me. This was created on a disposable Kali Linux Virtual Machine using random proxies all over the world! This is technically a throwaway but I kinda like the name I got with it.

The account creation process was already slow due to chaining proxies but then it was pretty slow to verify captcha each time! But it is doable. you need to setup proxy-chains on Kali Linux and configure it using tor's random proxies and then you are kind of done for the network anonymity but then comes the challenge of actually assuming an identity. You have to avoid all the general personal traits while creating the accounts. I chose proton mail for the email client but still it asked for a verification using mobile number! This step took a lot of time as I had to get a phone number which cannot be traced to me but well lets say it was taken care of. After you have a mail id set up and ready to go, you can pretty much get going on to sites which does not require a personal verification using some kind of mobile number. I think authenticator apps can work but I do not have a spare phone which I can load a FOSS OS on so that step is missing.

It is definitely doable, but you have to be very careful just in case you accidentally reveal some important info regarding yourself. This should help any one trying to get her or his word out and are kind of in a fix due to their identity being in a crisis. I would encourage people to be anonymous but be genuine, which is a hard thing to ask for given the anonymity! Kind of a see saw in my opinion, one always goes down when the other comes up. Trust and Anonymity that is.

For those who treat reddit like a social media: Yes I have negative karma due to one comment which I posted, but then reddit karma isn't my doing, its all of you in the community! 

  
If anyone can add to any way how the process of creating an email without verification can be achieved, it would probably be helpful to all of the others.",2020-03-14 02:40:19

As a result of AMR, drugs become unusable, leading to loss of life and more side effects. Although it may not seem to be the biggest problem in the country right now, what with SARS-Cov-2 and the growing political divide in India. But it will be a severe problem in the times to come. it is projected, by UN Ad hocInteragency Coordinating Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, that by the year 2050 AMR solely will cause 10 million deaths and by 2030, AMR could also force about 24 million people intoextreme poverty.

If this problem alarms you in any way, then please consider helping us, the 2020 iGEM Team from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Tirupati. Internation Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) is an international competition held each year at MIT, Boston. It focuses on synthetic biology ideas that can be commercialised. 

For this year, we have decided to bioengineer bacteria to degrade excess antibiotics in the environment. The 2019 iGEM team from IISER Tirupati brought home gold last year, and we intend to make our country proud on the international stage in the same manner.

A possible way to do this is make a mobile app tracker where user answers questions relevant to the symptoms and on the basis of available data and known factors, we could assign him a score of having the diseases.

And  the internet goes when the power goes off.

I used to live in an apartment before and never cared for much of these things then. Just paid for the internet (changed from local to ACT to hathway). All of them used to work when I removed the rj45 cable from router and connected to laptop directly. Used to think the cables are fiber and didn't need any electricity.

The Tweet:
https://twitter.com/RenukaJain6/status/1226702402599866370

The article:
https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/ancient-fire-ritual-has-positive-impact-on-environment-scientists/article2103881.ece#

In this, a guy named Prof VPN Nampoori is said to have been researching on an ancient Vedic ritual called ""Athirathram"" which he claimed germinates seeds at a much faster rate, etc. He said:

> “The findings would not only help dispel superstitious notions associated with Vedic rituals but also help in continuation of such tradition for the betterment of nature and the environment,” says Nampoori.

This didn't sit right with me, so I went to Google to search on this. Being a fan of a YouTuber Potholer54, I wanted to get some research papers, not media articles. And as I suspected, I found none. Even in his own profile in his University, there is no such study. I searched his LinkedIn, ResearchAcademy, etc but didn't find anything (I may have missed something, its possible). Rather I found this:

https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kerala-professor-cusat-suspended-allegedly-fudging-data-while-authoring-articles-64342

This news article accuses him of fudging data. I further found this:

https://ssmkerala.org/teamssm.html

This is a pseudoscience movement, basically trying to 'fuse Hinduism with Science', you know, the usual pseudoscience mumbo jumbo like Deepak Chopra. This professor is a member of RSS too. Joined together, this clearly indicates that this was a hoax study just like the one that ISRO used 'Vedic Maths' in their calculations for their recent space mission, circulated by right wingers. I am still searching about it, if I find something, I will update.

I am still a little shocked though as to why a reputed media like The Hindu would share such a hoax.",2020-02-11 23:42:29

I have a dedicated server with GoDaddy that I use to host simple wordpress sites. One day I randomly decided to log into the server to check one of the sites and realized that I was unable to access the hosting. After sometime with tech support I was able to log in only to realize that my entire data was wiped clean. At first, the tech support tried to blame this to some ""hacking"" incident but when I kept asking for details such as the method of hacking, ip addresses used and other info, they reluctantly opened a support ticket. A day later they came back with a response saying that there was a problem with the server and they were moving the data which they lost somehow. They lost 25 sites that were hosted and didn't even offer an apology.

I called tech support again and they said that it was my fault for not keeping backups. When I asked for a refund for the hosting let alone the loss of data, the customer service representative asked me not to act ""smart"" as they are not responsible for anything.

Google Pixel Quality Control and the scam pertaining to after sales service by conducted by b2x,10,Science/Technology,ithehappy,fkvenf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkvenf/google_pixel_quality_control_and_the_scam/,0,1584588226.0,"Dear Readers,

In early 2017 I created a post on reddit which was something like- Think hard before getting a Pixel in India, after having nightmarish experience with HTC service centre. Now after almost three years, I am creating this topic, which will show you what I meant then, give it more substance and additionally will reflect what scam is being conducted by its third party service provider namely B2X. Kindly take the time to read it in full.

• May, 2017: I purchased a Google Pixel XL from Flipkart effectively for Rs. 43,499 (Price was Rs. 53,499 but there was a ridiculous exchange offer of Rs. 10,000 on Asus Zenfone 5).

• July-August, 2019: The phone was running fine during this period of 2 years 2 months but suddenly the microphone crapped out. Obviously the tech world was already known with Google Pixel 2016 infamous microphone issue which Google themselves acknowledged and with respective lawsuits affected users are getting up to USD 500 refund in the US. Anyhow, I called support and they arranged a pickup and afterwards I received a service charge quotation of Rs. 3,251 from B2X. I initially rejected to pay, as the issue is acknowledged by Google and proven as a hardware defect. But their team lead somehow sweet talked me out of it, sir, we will also change the motherboard of the device within that cost and so on. So I paid the amount.

I receive the phone back, expecting it to repaired and extremely tensed that they might have put scratches on it, as mine was in immaculate condition even after two years of usage, I unpack the Fedex box and shocked! That's not my phone. A phone which is wrapped in plastic sheet and 'looked like a brand new device', of 128 GB no less. I was over the moon for like an hour. It was totally discharged. I charged it and turned it on and found it was running the Nougat firmware still. Whatever, I started using it in full cheerful state. Google customer support zindabaad.

Update: Google customer support sent me a email dated 23 Mar, 2020, acknowledging that the replacement device they sent me back in August, 2019 was indeed a Factory-tested device, worth of Rs. 17,999 only. So nutshell is- without even informing me they sent me a refurbished device. Fantastic. 

• December, 2019: Not even four month passes, and this replacement device now has a broken vibration module out of the blue. Vibration is the only mode I use on my phones so I couldn't ignore it. Called Google support again, another pick up and this time B2X quoted me a service charge of Rs. 1,539, in which the actual hardware costed like 400 rupees only and the rest was there service charge with tax, Lol. Anyway, I paid it.

https://i.imgur.com/IwDv7EO.png

• January, 2020: Less than a month passes by, the vibration motor is dead again. I said OK Google, Assistant doesn't trigger, no kidding......I called the support again and another pickup was conducted and this time they repaired the vibration module for free. As they didn't have any other option as it was within 30 days from last service.

• 04th March, 2020: It has been 20 odd days since the last service, now the phone at one fine morning suddenly died on me. I mean I was watching a Linus video or something, and it just rebooted once, pops up on homescreen and then totally goes blank. I was pretty sure the battery crapped up or something. But no, it never turned back on, no matter what I tried. So I do the obvious, call Google support again and yet another pick up and now the main point, this time around B2X has initially quoted me a service charge of Rs. 25,104 (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand One Hundred and Four only). I was what? Then someone calls me over phone and tells me there is a discount on this and the revised service charge will be of Rs. 21,724. I said outright to him that I will not be paying a single penny and I will be initiating legal steps.

https://i.imgur.com/LhFIog9.png

To sum up; I have paid Rs. 43,499 for a Pixel XL in May, 2017. The device then crapped up with the infamous microphone issue which is Google's own manufacturing defect and the same acknowledged two years down the line, I paid Rs. 3,251 for it. In return which I received a device 'looked like a new phone'. Barely four months pass, the vibrator failed, for which I paid Rs. 1,539. Then the vibrator fails again, no charge this time. So a total of Rs. 4,800 down the drain for service charge only. And now, then want me to pay Rs. 21,724 rupees, to repair my phone as motherboard replacement cost. 

Justify this, you pay Rs. 50,000 (original price plus service charge) and then in the end you have a dead device and to make it un-dead B2X/ Google wants Rs. 21,724.  I have already emailed them, tweeted them but no reply, yet, and their sugar coated replies by the customer service are made in a way to lure you in, like before sending in the phone this time, they assured me, sir, this time the problem will be completely taken care of and you will have no problems in the future whatsoever. And this is them taking care of the problem. I am certain there is no connection between the customer care and B2X. B2X runs its own dirty games, either with or without Google's connivance.

This post was created to gain traction, that is it. No other purpose it is meant for. I really don't want to hear opinions about how Chinese OnePlus minus or meme company phones are better, I am not into those, I will never be. So anyone caring about Pixels, the camera and the software experience (which is hands down sublime, but still outdone totally by the pathetic hardware quality control) kindly do me a favour. Vote this post up, so that it can be seen by as many people as possible and share this post in other places if you kindly. Also, if there are other places where I can post this topic which will gain more traction kindly advise me of the same, I will be grateful to you.

I have quickheal for more than 2 years now and its just ending. Now you know when these services end they usually show things to make you extend your subscription. So a couple days ago i got a noti that Quick Heal removed a Trojan virus from my computer. Now i have not done any torrent downloads in a long time and theres no way it got to my pc. I thought was it weird that quick heal found a trojan coincidentally as my subscription was coming to an end? Could it be a marketing strategy?,2020-02-03 19:14:43

Here is what I know about it -> It allows any one to mine coins (or Pi to be precise) via a mobile App (IOS and Android). So unlike other crypto currency, you do not need massive computing power to mine and participate in the project.

It has been developed by three Standford PhDs. It is still in beta phase so you need to be invited by a member (see end of article).

I went on to verify the identity of the three founders and found the following:

Here was a message from one of the team members on the Pi in app chat.

“three of the core members of the team are Stanford graduates. I am a grad from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. The others two are Stanford PhDs (who taught a blockchain development course at Stanford). We are trying to be deliberate about how we introduce ourselves to the community. Appreciate your patience with us while we work on team page, intros etc.”

I therefore went on the Stanford Center for Blockchain Research website (https://cbr.stanford.edu/) to check if it was true and found that

1. Vince Mcphillip who is on that team member list. From his LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentmcphillip).
2. Nicholas Kokkalis who is also on the https://blockchaincollective.io/ and is listed as a Stanford PhD on his LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kokkalis/)
3. Chengdiao Fan who is a Stanford PhD, I found her link from Nicholas’s LinkedIn page.

This I believe confirms the Stanford University link and lends more credibility to the team, and that was deeply reassuring because it means they have

a) a deep understanding on the subject and

b) they also have an unlimited supply of students to pick from to contribute to the project.

Almost everything in any Indian language is hard to read (for me Hindi/Guj) and/or ugly to see (Tamil/Kannada etc). I did not care until I had to read and reply to emails. 

This is what the [font manager shows](https://i.imgur.com/CyG0ivJ.png) / [fails to show](https://i.imgur.com/bXmLplL.png). And this applies to all Indic fonts - Devnagari, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali etc

Tried using various fonts as defaults, no difference.
In Windows, the same fonts look beautiful using the same Font/Character encoding settings in browsers.

Edit: Fonts suck on other apps too like Telegram and other system apps. I also tried using Segoe UI systemwide but doesn't help.

Edit 2: I was able to fix fonts in Firefox but not on Brave. On Firefox it was a browser issue/bug (I already had selected proper fonts for each language).

Nirmala UI has glyphs of Segoe UI + glyphs from Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam & Sinhala.

IAF says – “Ready for a 2-front war”. Really?,12,Science/Technology,ReadwithKartikeya,erww88,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/erww88/iaf_says_ready_for_a_2front_war_really/,5,1579652534.0,"*By: Kartikeya Semwal* 

It is good to see that IAF (Indian Airforce) is working hard to move from strength to strength by acquiring different types of fighter planes, transport aircrafts and different types helicopters. But this doesn’t mean that it is ready to fight any type of war, especially when it is about fighting a two-front war on western and eastern fronts. Though IAF has been carrying out war games, operational exercises, joint exercises with friendly countries but it doesn’t mean that it is ready and well equipped for a two-front war. 

The most important point is still the same- lack of enough jet fighters to complete full squadron-strength of 45. We all know that the last of Mig-21s were retired a few months back in 2019 that had brought down IAF’s squadron strength to 33. But recently, with retiring of Mig-27 3rd generation fighters lovingly called “Bahadur” by IAF, the current squadron strength is down to a dangerous low of 28. And if that was not enough then here me out loud- IAF intends to retire upgraded jaguars and Mig-29s in the next 10 years. 

&#x200B;

[Mig-27 or \\""Bahadur\\"" of IAF in action. ](https://preview.redd.it/6k50itvjm5c41.jpg?width=647&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaa407e1c20598e7d4a17f462363e2a915457298)

So IAF’s statement of “we are ready to fight a two-front war” completely undermines itself. No doubt our Air Force chief and our brave pilots are patriotic and ready for challenges, but that doesn’t works when it comes to fighting a war. Numbers do matter, especially when you have a neighbour like China which is continuously upgrading its armed forces. China’s PLA-Airforce is working night & day to add over 600 aircrafts including fighter jets in the next decade (10 years). Most of these are combat jets and are of 4th and 5th generation. Not to mention the J-10, J-15, J-20 and J-31. 

&#x200B;

[From Top Left to Right: J-10, J-15, J-20 & J-31    ](https://preview.redd.it/yqaxuhuzm5c41.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ab367f8aa1963a0b870c41f34dafe1cbe2ad915)

Once they get those number of fighters up and flying, they will gain control over not just all of Asia but also over the Pacific region, which is of great importance for sea-trade, international business and rich in resources. Now we all know that IAF is acquiring 40 Tejas Mk-1 fighters followed by 43 Tejas Mk-1As totalling to 83 combat jets of 4th generation. There have been talks about IAF might buy 114 Tejas Mk-II or MWF but when & in how many years? Even if we consider that they will do so in the next 10 years, but is that enough? Not at all.  

&#x200B;

[Above: LCA Tejas & Tejas Mk-II or MWF Concept Design](https://preview.redd.it/pcxo7karn5c41.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd90c5372ab0246e05890c06724efb0a92d9ac4b)

Rafale considered as 4.5+ generation fighter that has the calibre to take out 5th generation fighters of China (J-20 & J-31) are being acquired by IAF but only 36, and that too only by 2026. Now the question arises- what it China attacks India in the next 1-3 years?

The answer is, if that happens IAF will be doomed. Now it is clear that action is needed & at a fast pace. The one and only solution to increase the number of IAF’s fighting squadrons to take on a two-front war & ‘fight will full force’ is- ask HAL to increase the production of LCA Tejas jets & buy at least 5-6 squadrons (80 to 98) of a new jet. But if they don’t want to buy it then they should at least take the same number of fighter planes on lease for the next 10 years. IAF has already zeroed in on Saab’s Gripen E & Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Both are on par with each other and both are 4.5 generation fighters. Getting any one of them will not only improve IAF’s firepower, but it will also make up the numbers and nullify the psychological advantage China’s PLA Airforce has over us.

&#x200B;

[F\/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III being offered to India](https://preview.redd.it/6a5h8hbdo5c41.jpg?width=739&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4a4aa08ea284e27a6b4d6227bfa40073af74b8f)

 Meanwhile, India can continue design-development & production of Tejas Mk-II or the MWF (Medium Weight Fighter) that will be a 4th+ generation twin-engine fighter and will form the backbone of IAF in future. They are already carrying out induction of Tejas Mk-1s & Mk-1As but that too needs to be speeded up to improve the numbers. If I were to choose, I would go for Super Hornet Block-III. My reasons are simple, 

1. It will bring a whole new set of technologies, hardwares, softwares, missiles and ammunition. India will also get access to much-needed powerful engine & its technology that HAL, DRDO & ADA have failed to make on their own over the years. 

2. Also, Super Hornet is battle-proven & its war-fighting abilities are unknown to both Pakistan & China. 

3. Another reason is that this fighter jet is not present in either Asia or in the Pacific region. Thus, giving an advantage to IAF and disadvantage to China coz they don’t know much about it. 

4. One more reason is that it is cost-effective and IAF pilots have already flown & tested it and are satisfied with its performance.  

5. Last but not least. India can buy 2 Super Hornets for the price of 1 Rafale fighter jet being offered by France. So the numbers do matter. 

If this happens, then IAF will actually ‘be ready & fit’ to fight a two-front war if needed. Now I leave it up to all of you reading this article as to what should be done to address the problem of IAF’s depleting squadrons so they can match our eastern enemy.

"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",388,Policy/Economy,ringtring,fv9ifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,64,1586098195.0,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",2020-04-05 20:19:55

We don't have the capacity to make advanced drugs . India mostly makes generic medicines . Hence we need to import them too .

Moreover Vodafone a large international company failing due to GOI greed will be death knell of foreign investments into India. Imagine a govt so careless they allow such a large company such as vodafone to go bankrupt due to utter stupid policies.

## Tl;dr

With a view to address the public health challenges due to Covid-19 a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy. We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India.  This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.

We devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing.  To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court’s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It's possible if we try!

## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off

The world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.

However, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.

Recognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.

## Overview of the working paper

This [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.

Following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person’s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.

Finally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, “.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

## We have three primary objectives from this working paper

*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.

*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.

*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don't have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?

We will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.

This working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.

https://preview.redd.it/zy87u6z1uqq41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b456dedb4224dca0f38034a8c4be6011624aaf

### Tl;dr

We wrote to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to ensure reform of India’s internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. 

### Background

On 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India’s internet shutdown framework.  The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.

The government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   


### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications

We first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*

Noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   


### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs

We also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. 

We recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.

# Tl;dr

IFF wrote to the Jammu and Kashmir Government and Ministry of Home Affairs seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Kashmir during the COVID 19 crisis. The region is already struggling to recover from the six month long shutdown imposed on 5 August 2019 and several of its key healthcare indicators are below the national average. Therefore, immediate restoration of 4G internet services in the region is necessary to prevent spread of the virus through telemedicine and effective public outreach.

# Free and Open Internet for All

[\(Screenshot of ToI's tweet before it was deleted\)](https://preview.redd.it/qfb2xn7mkyo41.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed515e7a9ee26e760826e15eb81d154e0395548c)

&#x200B;

Yesterday, the Times of India tweeted that 4G internet services had been restored in Jammu and Kashmir but it subsequently deleted the tweet and published another [**article**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fake-alert-order-claiming-4g-internet-to-be-restored-in-jammu-alone-is-fake/articleshow/74814962.cms) about this information being false. This led to considerable confusion and it once again brought into sharp focus the continued deprivation of rights suffered by the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

While the rest of India transitions to work from home and relies on the internet to seek latest COVID 19 information and stay in touch with loved ones, the internet is still being slowed down to 2G speed in Jammu and Kashmir.  Jammu and Kashmir already has 7 confirmed COVID 19 cases. With these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the Government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives.  

# Dashboards and Chatbots for All

While responding to the COVID 19 crisis, the Indian Government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. Take for instance, the Ministry of Health’s COVID 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. The Ministry of Health and MyGovIndia have also collaborated with WhatsApp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. Even private players like Apollo Hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing COVID 19 through a mobile app. However, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the Government is slowing down their internet speed to 2G which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.

# Telemedicine for All

The difficulty in communicating through video on a 2G internet connection also means that doctors in Jammu and Kashmir cannot use telemedicine. During pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. Reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. However, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2G internet services.

Healthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. The essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the Ministry of Home Affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown. Therefore, depriving the people of Jammu and Kashmir of meaningful internet connectivity during a pandemic is completely unconscionable and the Government must immediately restore 4G services to reduce suffering and loss of life.

We are facing one of the most challenging times in human history. We are facing one of the most severe medical crises since WW1 which will have economic effects that may rival or exceed the great depression. In such a time there is global deffecit of leadership from Modi in India to Trump in America,45,Policy/Economy,asdfghqw8,funp0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/funp0c/we_are_facing_one_of_the_most_challenging_times/,14,1586004972.0,"There is a global crises of leadership. Under Trump and his America first policy, America has receded from the world stage leaving space for China, space which China used to gain influence over the WHO, the current chief of the WHO always had a favourable standing with China, with his rival for the chairmanship of the WHO Dr David Nabarro alleging during the race for the chairmanship that the current WHO chief has close contacts with China and it's leadership. These allegations are further reaffirmed when the WHO chief went to Wuhan on the 13th of January 2020 and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the Corona Virus. The above events show Trump's failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage. Trump also took the Corona Virus very very lightly, downplaying the intelligence over the same provided by his own national agencies, he has previously ignored serious advisories by his national agencies, for example Russia's interference in US elections and the Khashguni murders. 

Now coming to India, no political party in India has ever worked on the health infrastructure, other than a few marquee projects like building one or two AIIMS. This is the same for this government as well, however other governments failings do not justify this governments lack of action with regards to building health facilities. Currently India has .8 doctors per thousand patients, which is well below recommended standard. I'm sure even this figure is inflated as of late the government has started to recognise or offering bridge programs to AYUSH doctors.

When the Delhi state government, started to build Mohalla Clinics, then the current ruling national government tried it's best to stop their development, the D.D.A, which is controlled by the Central Government, didn't alot them any land, forcing Mohalla Clinics to be built on the side of the roads in porta cabins. As they were on the side of the roads they are cramped, such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease. Now the government knows that it's going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn't come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the Corona Virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in South Korea.

The question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in Hungary.

Edit: I would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in India also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in India, it's doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers, and according to the governments own admission in the Supreme Court 1 in 3 people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having Covid19. Couple that mass exodus of covid19 carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace, will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace.

Edit 2: now trump has stopped shipment of N95 masks, which was ment for and paid for by other countries. In fact a shipment of N95 which was just transiting through a U.S. port ""disappeared"", the shipment was heading to Germany.

Is Trump crazy, he is isolating America and Americans at their time of greatest needs. For example Germany is a major industrial power, it may manufacturer components that are needed in circuit boards of Ventilators, what if it stopped the shipment of those circuit boards? Canada has already pointed out that a lot of all nurses go from Windsor Ontario to North American cities like Detroit.

With no major production and export, how are we going to make money to feed the poor and daily wage workers. Are we in for collapse like Greece? Or are we going to be okay? I know at this time saving lives is paramount. But even for that we need cash, right!",2020-04-07 07:32:08

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* The excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post.",2020-04-12 20:39:11

Can we talk about the disgrace that is the AYUSH ministry?,478,Policy/Economy,tHeSiD,f23t7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f23t7b/can_we_talk_about_the_disgrace_that_is_the_ayush/,82,1581427799.0,"So, I was travelling over the weekend to my village and other tier 2 cities, and almost everyone closed to me was asking whether I took the corona vaccine. I was confused as to what vaccine, because I thought there isn't a vaccine yet. They were saying  it was recommended by the  government and everyone is  taking it to be safe and I should take it too. They then told me it’s a homeopathic medicine that everyone is taking to be safe from corona virus. Its called Ars Alb 30. A homeopathic medicine based on Arsenic Album. I laughed it off and told them its all stupid whatsapp forwards and homepathy doesn’t work etc etc and didn't bother much about it. 

But, my sister recently had a baby and when I met her MIL she gave me a packet telling me they were medicines for my sister. I gave them to my sis and she asked my why I am giving her [this](https://i.imgur.com/qVKmkZQ.png). I was baffled and eventually realized this was the ""corona vaccine"". I told her to ignore it and she did.

Delhi Police admits to using drones on civilians without any publicly available legal guidelines in place,120,Policy/Economy,InternetFreedomIn,fprst3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fprst3/delhi_police_admits_to_using_drones_on_civilians/,9,1585317810.0,"&#x200B;

**Tl;dr**

With reports now emerging that the Delhi Police is using drones to check for people who are breaking the curfew in Delhi, we examine responses we have received in reply to Right to Information requests filed about the usage of drones in Delhi in February. The Delhi Police admits to hiring drones for various purposes over the course of the last few months including the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections and during the riots in North-East Delhi. This is being done with no guidelines in place for their use and thus are not only a violation of the right to privacy of individuals but also a tool of mass surveillance in the hands of the government.  


**Wait… What?**

The Delhi Police has been using drones for surveillance of crowds for quite some time now. The first [**reports**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/anti-caa-stir-delhi-police-use-drone-to-keep-track-of-protesters-1629729-2019-12-19) emerged in December, 2019 when it was reported that anti-CAA protests had been surveilled via drones to keep a close eye on the protesters. This was in addition to the Delhi Police’s use of [**Fa**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/)[**cial Recognition Technology**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/) to identify the protesters (read our previous blog post where we sent a notice to the Delhi Police to cease such use [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)).  


Subsequently, there were [**reports**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/from-facial-recognition-system-to-four-layer-security-delhi-police-gears-up-for-r-day-11579892354659.html) that the Delhi Police used drones on crowds during the Republic Day parade in January, 2020 to “maintain vigil”. In February, 2020 there were [**reports**](https://thewire.in/government/delhi-riots-police-special-commissioner) that the Delhi Police had used drones to “monitor the situation” during the riots in North-East Delhi.   


Now [**reports**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5146-held-in-delhi-for-defying-lockdown-1018-vehicles-seized/articleshow/74801660.cms) are emerging that the Delhi Police is using [**drones**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/covid-19-drones-used-to-enforce-lockdown-more-booked-for-violating-prohibitory-orders/articleshow/74831906.cms) to ensure that people do not violate the 21-day curfew imposed by the Government in a bid to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus.   


**The Delhi Police confirms using drones**

On February 14, 2020, we filed a Right to Information request with the Delhi Police asking the following questions:

1. Whether the Delhi Police has procured drones for any purpose?

2. Details of the tender issued for such procurement.

3. Information about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.

4. Information with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.

5. Whether these drones were deployed in December, 2019 and January, 2020?

6. Any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the Delhi Police.  


Our request was transferred to various departments of the Delhi Police. We received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. However, in a reply dated March 13, 2020, the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police confirmed that they have been using drones.    


**Here is a point-wise summary of their reply:**

1. The North-East District has **hired** drones for maintaining law and order.

2. Since the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.

3. The Delhi Police has been hiring drones from the open market through Station House Officers (SHO).

4. The technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the PIO.

5. The PIO confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election which were held on February 8, 2020 and during the riots in North-East Delhi which began on February 23, 2020.

6. In response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the Delhi Police, the reply was “no comment”.

**Why does this matter anyway?**

There are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in Delhi.

1. Hiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. As a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.

2. Since there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. There is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed.    


**So what now?**

IFF has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a [**legal vacuum**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/). The only [**regulations**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183093) for drones in India are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Drones are being used in Delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. It is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. We urge the Delhi Police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. If not, we urge the Delhi Police to immediately cease such use. This is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.

Oil slump?

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction.

https://preview.redd.it/p3vb8eexzxr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80eb8a5aafc7092e4017557ca41921f18c872f1

**Tl;dr**

According to a Hindustan Times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-SMsYXKFoz9OPG2VBIKrA8L.html) dated April 07, 2020, the NSO Group has created a surveillance application to track COVID-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**What happened?**

Last year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   


**What is the law related to hacking?**

Surveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


Additionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**

We are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group  is “actively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.”   


It was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors  like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**Our recommendations**

1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.
3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.

It is being said that after 31st March, these Stressed Assets will need to be classified as NPAs. All of a sudden the NPA on books will increase by Rs 9 LAKH CRORES. (Eg 80,000 cr NPA of Mudra Scheme introduced in 2015)

UN recently came out with a report that stated 'India's debt has surpassed to over 40% of its GDP'

It's just that until 31st March, most of these were not official recognised as NPA and hence people are not alarmed. Will the economy completely tank after 31st March or will we able to handle this shockwave?

I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.",2020-04-07 10:59:46

Overpopulation - how I would go about trying to fix it,0,Policy/Economy,ratbert3,fz16t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz16t8/overpopulation_how_i_would_go_about_trying_to_fix/,21,1586626352.0,"By 2050, we are projected to add a further ~300mn more to our current 1.3bn to reach a total of 1.7bn. Quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of income/wealth inequality, as we're seeing played out in the Coivd-19 crisis. This problem is not limited to India alone, as all of South Asia has gone/is going through the same boom, putting further pressure on limited resources in the region. 

Political parties don't want to touch this issue, and for good reason - India has a dark past with population ""control"". The Indian state, further, cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the Chinese state had in the past (one child policy). In any event, I personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies, whether that means having 5 children or no children. 

In my view, what's required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who don't have children, in addition to current policies encouraging contraception. Participation will be totally voluntary. The following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless:-

1. Government issues bonds that mature in 30/40/50 years. It could be called the Bonds Issued To Childless Hedonists (**BITCH**). At maturity, this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at 65. Instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents, the bond will. The corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services. 

2. Alternatively, government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity.

3. In lieu of cash payments/bond issues, government could award agricultural land to childless persons. The value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees.

4. Medals/certificates/government mandated public approval. I personally don't care for this, but most people do. In any event, Indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion.

5. Encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier. I think this could work, but is also very open to abuse (people adopting orphans for payouts/child abuse already prevalent in adopted children), so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control. 

6. School/university education geared towards encouraging childlessness. It's clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently, but even at peak efficiency, resources will be consumed. The best way to reduce one's environmental impact would be to not have children.

I want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary - there is no hint of coercion. However, in order to ensure participants remain childless, there will likely a degree of enforcement required. For instance, participants will have to undergo vasectomies/tubal ligations. Naturally, government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants. Having said that, government already has full knowledge of parents/children through its Aadhar database. Further, all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery.

I actually think there will be an uptick of cases in the next few weeks what with all the clapping nonsense and dancing in the streets and now this rampaging through the commercial areas and crowding, and totally erratic behavior all round and the shite show with the police beating up everybody on plain sight without empathizing with people who Might actually have a valid reason to be outside.

I mean I get the bit about lockdowns, but half the time, its just a shite-show with all the ppl running to the stores, crowding up and being very erratic overall and I am not criticizing that, as that is perfectly understandable, we never know what these ppl are going through, it could be an essential for their ailing grandparents or their cancer stricken child, but does anybody think the lockdowns are almost always haphazard in their execution, and it seems to be defeating the purpose of it all.

Some of the success stories like Taiwan, hk, and even South Korea, its more about social distancing, and wearing masks at all times and practicing good hygiene especially around the elderly, and finally controlling the inbound and outbound flights and treating the airports as ground zero and being very vigilant with the quarantine, hongkong implemented trackers for all incoming passengers with threat of serious consequences i.e fines and even solitary confinement,  and it seems to have worked a treat. Lockdowns were not really implemented as they thought it would be counter productive and stores and super markets and public transportation facilities  were kept open 24x7 with a condition that only 30% of the capacity allowed at any given time, which was actually sensible rather than shutting down everything or having limited operating hours which just creates a mad rush and totally counter productive. 

yeah, I honestly think a lot of countries have never faced a situation like this. uncharted territory really, but looking at the success stories like south korea and hk, and even Taiwan, and replicating the exact same strategies would have gone a long way, instead of haphazardly implementing draconian counter-productive strategies that have not been thought through. (shades of demo all over again, what with the initial applauding by the upper middle class who can just sit at home and play in their ps4, the average redditor here, and then slowly waking up and smelling the coffee as the hours tick by)

Misconceptions about South Korean approach to COVID containment (as compared to India's).,39,Policy/Economy,ColdFood8,fr25gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fr25gg/misconceptions_about_south_korean_approach_to/,6,1585496310.0,"Firstly, I am Indian and have lived in Korea for ~5 years. In this threat I want to draw attention to differences in Indian and Korean approach to COVID containment. I am doing this because I have seen lot of whatsapp forwards and talked to few friends and relative who think that Indian approach is more or less same as South Korea.

Before I get started, I want to clarify I am not criticizing any of two approach. This is comparison with respect to what is currently considered best practice. I understand circumstances limit how well it can be copied in India.

**Testing**

India: Must be international traveler or have come in contact with infected person. Recently, pneumonia cases are also allowed to be tested.

Korea: Anyone can get tested. If you have any symptoms, you call a number, they direct you to nearest center. A doctor check you and if symptoms match, you get test for free. Additionally, if   you come in contact of any infected person, you get test for free. If you are just worried and want to get tested, you pay ~120$.

**Treatment Cost**

India: I have no information on this.

Korea: ~40$ if you have national insurance. ~1400$ if you don't. All citizens have it. ~50% foreigners have it.*

**Shut Down**

Korea: There is no broad shut down. Large gatherings (events, protest, etc.), religious congregations and karaoke are banned.#

India: Ya all know.

**Delivery**

India: Shit show.
Korea: No limitation what so ever. Encouraged.

Personal comment: Why the f govt. cares if someone want to order non essential stuff from amazon?

**Tracking & Isolation**

India: Wholesale isolation of anyone and everyone. Release excel files and put stickers, broadcasting the isolation of person/household.

Korea: If you are coming from COVID infected area, you must isolated for 14 days.^ If someone is found to be infected, his movement are traced and made public. If you live in same district or have visited it, you get message informing you off same. You can check the same online for each individual patient. 

**Business**

India: Shut down everything with limited exception.

Korea: No restriction. If someone is found to be infected, it is shut down for disinfection and things are back on soon.

**WFH**

India: Idk how common is this

Korea: Encouraged but not very common. Schools are closed, university is online.

An honest thought on how India could economically prosper,11,Policy/Economy,8TC,frks4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frks4g/an_honest_thought_on_how_india_could_economically/,10,1585573937.0,"This thought has been bothering me for sometime so maybe if I share it here, it might provide me some relief.  
Before I go further, I’d like to re-iterate again that this is just a thought & there maybe several ways to improve upon it.  
  
Firstly every citizen should be liable to pay direct tax. If it’s a farmer, poor person, any working adult should pay a measly suggested sum of say ₹10 **per fiscal year** as their share of tax.  

How would this help?  
  
First things first, we are too large a nation not to collect any direct tax from the vast majority of the people. I understand rich people pay more tax but only so much tax can be collected from them. I think the government may have stretched their limits here because increasing any rate on them would eventually funnel more money through their backdoors (black money, foreign tax havens).  
Also, it’s no hidden fact that the majority of black money is generated from agricultural activities which are not liable to report any income since they are fully exempt. Politicians & Rich businessman funnel a lot of money through this buy showing part of their income from agricultural land.  
It would also help the government to identify beneficiaries of their schemes because there will be somewhat accurate picture of the people who paid tax and are the benefactors of their scheme.",2020-03-30 18:42:17

Narendra Modi Likely To Declare A Emergency In India Under Article 360,8,Policy/Economy,AfzalOzil360,fpzu2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpzu2u/narendra_modi_likely_to_declare_a_emergency_in/,14,1585354679.0,"*It's a whatsapp forward. Wanted your opinion on this matter.*

Let us first understand, what is Article 360.

Article 360 in the constitution of India is for imposing a nationwide financial emergency in India.

Financial Emergency (Article 360):
Article 360 states that if the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or the credit of India or any part thereof is threatened, the President may declare a state of financial emergency.
During the period such Proclamation is in operation, the executive authority of the Union extends to the giving of directions to any State to observe such canons of financial propriety as may be specified in the directions, any such directions may also include:
A provision required the reduction of salaries and allowances of all or any class of person serving a State or the Union.
A provision requiring all Money Bills or other Financial Bills to be reserved for the consideration of the President after they are passed by the legislature of the State.
A Proclamation issued under Article 360 will remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the Houses of the Parliament.
A proclamation issued under Article 360 will remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the Houses of the Parliament.
Once approved it remains in force till revoked by the President.
No emergency under Article 360 has been issued so far.

India had been going through one of the worst phases of the financial crisis in its 72 years of history, India’s top 3 rating agencies like Fitch, Moody’s and S&P have already reduced India’s growth GDP to the lowest marks much before corona.

Now, this corona epidemic would have a long lasting & frightening effect on the Indian economy which might push India almost 70 years back similar to the partion era. Let’s connect the dots altogether.

1. The reserve bank of India has already made a war room with 90 people keeping an eye on the Indian economy which has never been done earlier in the entire history of the reserve bank.

2. Foreign investors pulled out 1.08 lakh crore rupees from Indian market in just 15 trading sessions

3. Almost 80% of the Indian companies are asking their employees to work from home, many companies including go air & air india have asked their staff to go on unpaid leaves, most companies have also terminated several employees.

4. Almost 80% of the major financial centers of the country are in lockdown including Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Chennai, Kolkatta, Gurgaon, Noida, Ahemdabad, Surat.

5. US Dollor has the all time highest value against Indian currency, at the time of writing this article 1:53 AM midnight 23 march 2020, 1 USD was equal to 75.62.

6. Corona cases in India at the time of writing this article has reached 415.

7. Several sectors including hotels, restaurants, night clubs, bars, airlines, BPO, tourism, entertainment & Bollywood, auto-mobile, aviation, hospitality, apparel, consumer durables and electronics, Poultry and Seafood, construction, transport, railway are worst hit by this epidemic.

8. Several associated sectors also had a huge impact on their revenues like oil-petrol, security service industry and many others whose revenues are directly & indirectly dependent on the above sectors.

9. Coronavirus infection is spreading like fire and Indian agencies would not be able to control it in the near future, if by any chance, it enters into the fourth stage, which it is most likely to enter due to citizens ignorance, it would be the worst crisis in the entire history of Independent India.

10. Right now coronavirus is only among rich & elite who are able to handle the financial burdens & have multiple resources in terms of healthcare, work, financial savings and can still to self isolate & prevent it from spreading but Once it enters into people under Below Poverty Line, it would almost be impossible to control it and a large chunk of India’s revenue would be invested to handle the situation.

11. The reserve bank stored funds including the contingency funds & emergency funds have already depleted after RBI gave multiple chunks of large money to the current government.

12. Several Private & government banks in India have the highest NPA and loan defaulters doesn’t seem to be in any mood to be paying it off soon.

13. The share markets of India, including the National Stock Exchange (NSE) & Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are continuously falling.

Connecting all the points from 1 to 13

One can easily understand that fighting coronavirus & controlling the economy of the country almost seems impossible for the current government.

We still hope for the best and wish all the luck to the government and its agencies to curb the situation.

If no steps would be of any help to control the economy, Narendra Modi would have no option but to impose the financial emergency in India under Article 360 and the country would go in its worst and most dreaded recession of all times.",2020-03-28 05:47:59

## TL; DR:

On 5th February, 2020 the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) announced the launch of its Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it provides the basis for the creation of the Digital Content Complaint Council (along the lines of a similar system in place for TV) to oversee content creation and distribution in the online video streaming space. Although there are only four signatories (as opposed to nine in the case of a previous iteration), there are rumbling that the group is seeking government endorsement of this initiative. We have written to the IAMAI and copied the letter to both the Union Ministries of Information & Broadcasting; and Electronics and Information Technology highlighting how this will lead to self-censorship to the detriment of internet users, creators, producers and competition within the market. Based on these grounds we have asked the industry body to roll back the code and asked government authorities to refrain from endorsing the framework.

## Background

This post is to update everyone that there is a risk brewing in India’s online video streaming space. And said risk could see us sleep walk into a scenario where online content in India, mimics its formulaic television counterpart. On 5th February 2020, at its annual India Digital Summit, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) launched its *Code for Self-Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers*. It follows up an earlier *Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers* the industry body had  put out in January 2019.

Unlike the previous code which had nine signatories, the latest iteration has just four signatories namely, Hotstar, Voot, Jio and SonyLiv. Prior signatories including Netflix, Zee5, AltBalaji, Arre and ErosNow were conspicuously absent at the new code’s launch. Other major players like Amazon (Prime) and Google (YouTube Premium) have stayed away from the process since its inception. Considering India has more than 35 online video streaming providers, the Code is not really representative of the entire industry’s position. So then why are we concerned if it is only being carried out by such a small number of players?

## Our Take: This is a precursor to self-censorship and for online streaming to go down the path of TV

Simply put it is the first step towards broad basing self-censorship as industry practice in India’s online video streaming space. If that is indeed the outcome, it would adversely impact internet users in India, creators, artists, production companies and so on. It is also likely to harm competition, innovation, investment and would facilitate industry capture by a few firms over the ecosystem.

The framework essentially builds on the original code of best practices through some key changes. First and most importantly, it seeks to establish an independent enforcement authority called the Digital Content Complaint Council (DCCC) to oversee a signatory’s content related practices. This DCCC mechanism is eerily similar and largely derivative of the [**Broadcast Content Complaints Council (BCCC)**](https://www.ibfindia.com/sites/default/files/Guidelines--Term%20of%20broadcas%20changes.pdf) (under the Indian Broadcasting Foundation) which essentially governs content on non-news and television channels in India.

We all know what that has meant to Indian television and how that has led to a largely homogenous content ecosystem, inundated by typical saas-bahu programming devoid of much creativity or pathos. Moreover, how often do we watch our favourite international content on TV and get bummed out that a large chunk of the programming has been edited out? In this context, the online video streaming space was a breadth of fresh air for Indian audiences who were fans of global and local storytelling. Further, it provided opportunities to local storytellers who had until then been rejected by traditional television, theatrical and radio media.

## The legal basis and policy need for this effort is questionable at best

In this context, it is disconcerting that even though there is no legal mechanism which empowers the DCCC, its ties with the Government are undeniable. The proposed DCCC is meant to be chaired by a retired High Court or Supreme Court judge. Also, the DCCC is designed to include three members from national level statutory commissions like the National Commission for Women (NCW), the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)  or the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Its composition would also facilitate incumbent business capture as the DCCC is meant to include three industry representatives and two online curated content providers (likely to be signatories to the Code). Considering the opaque manner (with no public/stakeholder inputs) in which the Code has been developed, and the public facing impact such a privately designed framework can have-- the legal validity of this effort remains dubious at best.

Second, such codified structures essentially provide the Government a parallel avenue with little to no legal accountability to apply pressure on businesses to censor people’s views and beliefs. It erodes channels for dissent and satire-- and is arguably incompatible with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under the Constitution of India.

Third, like the previous code on best practices, the new code for self-regulation talks about “prohibited content”. What is particularly dangerous is that the newest draft has been modified in a manner which makes the grounds for censorship vaguer. This would afford the DCCC with more discretion to remove certain speech/content which would otherwise be legal under the Constitution of India and also applicable laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  This is compounded by the fact that the DCCC does not envision membership of stakeholders from research, academia or free speech backgrounds, to act as a safeguard for people’s right to receive and impart information. Therefore, it may be concluded that this Code is merely a liability reduction initiative which is being pushed through at the cost of plurality, diversity and creativity-- all cornerstone’s of the right to free speech and expression.

## Our letter to IAMAI

In a [**letter dated 17th January, 2019**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LKE-1DkhtFY3ZWWXpRdnRuVEpwWmMzYW1kR21yejA3d2g0/view) we had previously written to the IAMAI voicing our objection to the initial Code for Best Practices. We argued it was a slippery slope which would act as a precursor towards self-censorship in the Indian online content space. Our beliefs are reinforced by the latest Code for Self-Regulation and we have [**sent a representation to the IAMAI**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b3eJQghsUwOJEYU1ri0ah2roO0BVSju0/view?usp=sharing) requesting them to roll back the effort. In addition, we have shared a copy with both the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), to brief them with the issues of endorsing the framework.

Extensive testing is an insurance to avoid lockdown,16,Policy/Economy,anotheruser2221,fwh7oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwh7oa/extensive_testing_is_an_insurance_to_avoid/,4,1586278895.0,"Singapore just had a spike of 120 cases yesterday because of a couple of dormitories. It seems like a small spark can cause a fire.

One of the main tools to resume partial economy for any country after the lockdown is aggressive testing and tracing until there is a treatment or vaccine. Several people think scaling up testing is not necessary which makes me sad. I am going to make an insurance-like case for that taking India as a case.

Some back of the envelope calculation:

Cost of a test: upto 60$ (in India)
Doing 500,000 tests per day for 100 days would cost $3 billion.

This sounds like a lot... until we look at the cost of lockdown which is ~ $120 billion for 3 weeks. So, basically with the cost of a single day of lockdown we should be able to test 500,000 people everyday for 200 days. And there seems to be reasonable confidence in science community that we may have a safe and effective drug for treatment by then.

There can be different strategies for how we will pick people for the 500k tests per day and that's a later discussion. I am more concerned about getting extensive test coverage so we can detect outbreaks early and do a much finer grained lockdown than a blunt country-wide lockdown.

But I was chatting with a friend of mine who suggested this possibility. I’m sure the history buffs would love to discuss this as disheartening as it is. 

So nobody really knows when the pandemic will end but one this is for sure that when it does end the economies of the countries are going to be in the shitter. It’s going to take a huge toll on the resources and thereby lead to resource shortage. In this scenario do you people think the countries will go to war over resources? I’m sure most countries who have somewhat a strategic thought have already thought of this and perhaps are bracing for the impact. While the country is suffering now it is also important for it to stock itself as well if the possibility of war is real. So it makes sense that sooner the country deals with this the better it might be prepared to deal with the next tragedy in waiting. 

I just want to know what people here think. I’m trying not to make this post political cause the spin will be different but please understand most of the countries have right wing leaders who have a horrible human rights record. I’m not speaking all the countries but most like America, India, Brazil, most middle eastern nations etc. then we have the China Russia and Korea. I mean are things perfectly lining up for the most favourable conditions for a war??!!

## Tl;dr

IFF has been tracking various facial recognition technology (FRT) projects in different stages of development all over India. In the first part of this three part series on FRT, we have mapped major FRT projects in different states and broadly classified them into two categories according to intended purpose: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity.

## The Government needs to calm down!

In 2015, [**Jacky Alcine**](https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/615329515909156865) was surprised to find an auto-generated album in his Google Photos folder which contained a photo of his African-American friends categorized as “Gorillas.” This categorization had been done by the facial recognition software that Google Photos used to automatically sort any photos uploaded by the user. After Jacky posted this image on Twitter, the resultant outrage was immediate and understandable and Google promptly removed the offending categorization.

In order to understand why this error occurred and why many civil liberties organizations are calling for a ban or a moratorium on FRT, we need to understand how machine learning occurs and how bias in the samples used will lead to bias in the recognition done by the software. However, even before understanding these important questions and trying to come up with workable solutions and standards, the Central Government and different State Governments have already started deploying FRT for two major purposes: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity.

## Facial Recognition for Security/Surveillance

One of the biggest causes of alarm currently is the [**Request For Proposals (RFP)**](http://ncrb.gov.in/TENDERS/AFRS/RFP_NAFRS.pdf) issued by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) which would be used to create a national database of photographs which would help in swiftly identifying criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like Passport, CCTNS , ICJS and Prisons, WCD Ministry's KhoyaPaya, NAFIS or any other image database available with police/other entity.

While this national level project is still in nascent stages, police departments of various states are already in possession of FRT developed by public and/or private developers such as:

1. [**TSCOP + CCTNS in Telangana**](https://www.medianama.com/2019/10/223-hyd-police-on-collecting-biometrics-of-suspects/)
2. [**Punjab Artificial Intelligence System (PAIS) in Punjab**](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/facial-recognition-ai-is-shaking-up-criminals-in-punjab-but-should-you-worry-too_in_5c107639e4b0a9576b52833b)
3. [**Trinetra in Uttar Pradesh**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/up-police-launch-trinetra-its-ai-powered-face-recognition-app-to-catch-criminals/1426618/)
4. [**Police Artificial Intelligence System in Uttarakhand**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-police-acquire-face-recognition-software-to-help-nab-criminals/story-hIO0dmwRfOcK9npC0IMjtM.html)
5. [**AFRS in Delhi**](https://thewire.in/government/delhi-police-is-now-using-facial-recognition-software-to-screen-habitual-protestors)
6. [**Automated Multimodal Biometric Identification System (AMBIS) in Maharashtra**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/biometric-identification-system-iris-fingerprint-scans-to-fight-crime-5864905/)
7. [**FaceTagr in Tamil Nadu**](https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-acquire-face-detecting-app/article23410231.ece)

We have already sent a notice to the Delhi Police over their illegal use of FRT during the recent protests in Delhi ([**Read about it here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)). In Telangana as well, there have been multiple instances where police officers have been illegally asking individuals to submit their biometrics.

Simultaneously, the Ministry of Railways has announced its own facial recognition based security/surveillance system called [**Internet Protocol (IP) based Video Surveillance System (VSS)**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=197330) to be provided by RailTel under the Nirbhaya Fund. The South Western Railway started implementing the first phase of this project, and it has stated [**in a press release**](https://swr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&dcd=3370&id=0,4,268) that it has been successful in developing a suitable facial recognition system which has 100% success rate in acquisition and matching of faces.

## Facial Recognition for Authentication of Identity

[**In a press release**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=183958), the Ministry of Civil Aviation announced the Digi Yatra Programme which primarily aims to increase the ease and efficiency with which passengers at airports are processed from the moment they step into the airport till they board their flight by making the whole process paperless and using the biometrics (face) of the passenger as their boarding pass. The Government has already started rolling out Digi Yatra on a trial basis in different airports like [**Hyderabad**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/hyderabad-airport-launches-face-recognition-system-for-entry-on-pilot-basis-1562059587608.html) (July 2018), [**Delhi**](https://www.medianama.com/2019/12/223-face-recognition-digiyatra/) (September 2018) and [**Bengaluru**](https://scroll.in/article/929851/facial-recognition-as-airports-in-india-start-using-the-technology-how-will-it-be-regulated) (December 2018).

Recently, the [**Telangana State Election Commission**](https://tsec.gov.in/pdf/ULBS_MPLTS/circulars/2020/Cir_No_111_TSEC-ULBs_2020_dated_18.01.2020_1401.pdf) also came up with a similar idea to counter impersonation in polls. TSEC with the help of the Telangana State Technology Services tested FRT in 10 polling stations in Kompally Municipality of Medchal Malkajgiri district by using the technology to verify the identity of voters by comparing the photographs taken at the polling station with photographs of the voters in the TSEC database.

FRTs are increasingly being used by educational institutions to verify the presence of teachers and students. The [**Gujarat Government**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-gujarat-new-system-of-teachers-attendance-through-face-recognition-5975585/) has introduced a FRT system with a geo-tagging feature which ensures that primary school teachers themselves are present in schools and they are not being replaced by unauthorized and unqualified “proxy” teachers. Elsewhere in Tamil Nadu, the Government Higher Secondary School in Triplicane has installed a camera which is equipped with FRT in order to mark attendance of students. Similarly, IIT Delhi also has a FRT enabled attendance app in place which is called Timble.

The most recent use of FRT for authentication of identity that we came across is proposed use of the technology by the Maharashtra Government in order to record who avails its Shiv Bhojan Scheme. Shiv Bhojan is a scheme aimed for impoverished sections of society, wherein in select locations around Mumbai, the Government will serve thalis of food at a nominal rate of Rs.10.

## Fighting Back against FRT

FRT projects are becoming dangerously popular in India with various national level projects (AFRS, DigiYatra and IP VSS) underway. However, all these projects have been implemented without any legislative framework governing their operation. Be that as it may, the most worrisome part is not just the implementation of a faulty FRT system but also the implementation of an accurate system which could become a tool of mass surveillance. These problems will be discussed in the next part of this series.

To counter this grave threat to the privacy of all Indians, IFF has taken various steps. We have sent legal notices to NCRB and Delhi Police against use of FRT without any statutory basis or procedural safeguards. We have also filed Right to Information requests in conjunction to every such instance of FRT that we have come across. We will keep you updated as and when we receive responses to our RTI requests.

An open letter to Justice A.P. Shah on the online video self-regulatory code,188,Policy/Economy,InternetFreedomIn,f34zc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f34zc2/an_open_letter_to_justice_ap_shah_on_the_online/,28,1581600006.0,"TL; DR:

Last week the the Internet and  Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) announced the launch of its Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. This code industry wide code is signed by just 4 online video streaming providers and is intended to apply to the entire sector. It will require self-censorship practices which are there in the Television sector to be implemented for online video streaming services such as Arre, Amazon Prime, MX Player and Netflix. The code also creates a private body called the Digital Content Complaint  Council (DCCC) to judge complaints and impose penalties. As per [**press reports**](https://www.livemint.com/industry/media/hotstar-voot-others-sign-up-to-form-complaints-council-for-ott-platforms-11580907470733.html) it will be headed by Justice A.P. Shah who is a steadfast defenders of civil liberties and democratic values. With a view to place the several concerns of institutionalized self-censorship and chilling effects, we wrote him an open letter yesterday.

## In detail

In the past [**we have repeatedly warned**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) of the dangers of a dangerous self-censorship system for online video services that is being championed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (""IAMAI""). This system is called the, ""Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers"" and we have [**in detail explained how this will cause tremendous damage**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) to artistic creativity, user choice and innovation in the video streaming sector. This essentially institutionalises a dangerous TV style self-censorship system that will have a chilling effect on the diversity of content and programming.

This ""Self Regulatory"" code also creates a judicial body with what is called as a, ""Tier 2"" for adjudicating any complaints on the content of the shows which are aired on online video streaming services. This body is called the Digital Content Complaint Council (""DCCC"") and when the intial complaints to the signatories of this code (which are online streaming companies) are not settled, it hears them as a judicial case. It also will determine complaints sent by government departments and also can take suo-motu action. Such powers are generally modeled from the Broadcast Content Complaint Council (""BCCC"") that is a body for television broadcasters in India. The results of such practices in the TV sector are for everyone to see (*or, due to censorship not see*).

As per [**media reports**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) the first Chairperson of the DCCC is the distinguished jurist and the retired Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, Hon'ble Justice (Retd.) Mr. A.P. Shah. We hold Justice Shah in the highest regard for his intellect and courage in being a consistent voice for democratic rights - [**especially media freedoms**](https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/x3Es2gcvZvuZbYqwiWMQuN/Justice-AP-Shah--Judge-of-the-brave.html). Due to the lack of response by the IAMAI we, yesterday sent an open letter to Justice Shah highlighting our concerns and prior correspondence. This is in our continuing effort that self-censorship practices that have made TV broadcast an arid medium do not migrate to the internet. Our letter to Justice Shah is a good faith effort. While we have the highest faith in his ability to adjudicate and hold this position while protecting free expression. However, the larger, industry wide model that is being institutionalized and is likely to be cemented that will last beyond his term is injurious.

Level of public hospital facilities in Indian states relative to incomes and populations,15,Policy/Economy,datashri,fmrqeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmrqeg/level_of_public_hospital_facilities_in_indian/,9,1584870920.0,"Hey guys,

I just compiled some open data on the amount of public healthcare facilities in Indian states, relative to the states' wealth and population.

The short report with some more details is at [the new website](http://datashri.com/indian_states_government_hospitals.html) but I am posting the important images below. Hope you like it.

&#x200B;

The correlation between state Net Domestic Product and the number of hospital beds, as well the correlation between state population and number of hospital beds is about 0.8 each. Furthermore, the correlation between the per capita income of the state and the number of hospital beds is about -0.2 - so, to a certain limited extent, states with more rich people have fewer public health facilities.

We are students here in USA. I know most of us have left India for a better future, but not all, some just came here with the thought of going back to India, making a difference. 
At this point, all the major countries are facing facing a huge pandemic. Though our Embassy here in the USA is working it's best for us. But, many are dying still, as per a recent interview by our Ambassador here, Mr. T.S. Sandhu, 10 indians were detected positive and 4 died(not sure of the death though). That along with the growing rate of deaths here in the USA, 4 days ago, maximum 300 people died in a day, from the past 2 days, 900+ people are dying in a day, and 25000+ are getting affected daily. The curve is growing, and it won't stop atleast for the next month or so. 

I wanted to make a request, can the government and the foreign ministry arrange for our flights back home? Back to India? Back to safety and a proper health care(usa would be modern, but not all of us can finance it here) ? 
We would be better safe back in India with a quarantine rather then here. Seeing the increasing curve here has got us all in a fuzz with little to no clearity of the near future. Also, that due to our univerties closing down, many of us lost jobs here. Now we have to depend on our parents back home to pay for our rent and groceries(which is huge, bringing back indian students can help in keeping the money in india, with the recession that is going to come soon too. 

I request the PM and Foreign Minister, along with other officials to please take a step fast and help us here.",2020-04-03 17:21:24

A. The most glaring instance of the government’s failure to support labour standards is the Ministry of Labour’s proposal to fix the national minimum floor wage at ₹178, without any defined criteria or method of estimation.

B. This could lead to a dangerous race to the bottom by individual States, in a bid to attract capital and investments. This is rightly being called ‘starvation wage’, especially given that the Ministry’s own committee recommended ₹375 as the minimum. 

C. Another concerning issue is that the four codes exclude over 95% of the workforce employed in informal units and small enterprises, who in fact are in greater need of legal safeguards

D. There is no clarity on who constitutes an ‘employer’, an ‘employee’ or an ‘enterprise’, giving the owner greater discretion to interpret the provisions while making it more difficult for the worker to draw any benefits from them.

E. The code on wages legitimises and promotes further contractualisation of labour, instead of abolishing it, by insulating the principal employer from liabilities and accountability in the case of irregularities on the part of the contractors.

F. it is proposed that ‘apprentices’ be no longer considered employees, at a time when evidence indicates that apprentices are made to do jobs of contractual as well as permanent employees. 

G. And if all this were not enough, the wage code also brings back the draconian provision of “recoverable advances”, a system that the Supreme Court clearly linked to coercive and bonded labour, wherein distressed and vulnerable migrant labourers could be bonded to work through advance payments. This is akin to modern forms of slavery, also encountered in rural labour markets.

H. Similarly, the eight-hour workday shift has been done away with, and multiple provisions of increased overtime have been inserted. The code also gives ample alibis to employers to evade bonus payments.

I. seeking justice against unfair practices of employers has become even more difficult now as non-payment of wages will now not be a criminal offence and penalties in case of non-compliance have been reduced. The government wants to provide a “facilitative” rather than a regulatory and punitive environment for the owners, with “facilitators-cum-inspectors” replacing the “inspectors” who used to ensure implementation of various labour laws to aid employees.

J. The code even has a provision on “employees below fifteen years of age”, which can be construed as legalisation of *child labour*.",2020-02-14 23:11:28

### Tl;dr

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition was finally listed for hearing today i.e. 9 April 2020 before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. During the hearing, the bench issued notice and the matter will be heard next after one week. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition contended that the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis violated fundamental rights to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice guaranteed by the Constitution of India. 

Despite the COVID-19 crisis gripping the country, the government has continued directing internet service providers to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G by citing security concerns. The most recent of these orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 was issued on [**03 April 2020**](http://jkhome.nic.in/22(TSTS)of2020.pdf) and it is due to expire on 15 April 2020.

2G is an outdated technology which was phased out in 2008 with the launch of 3G, and most modern websites and applications are too heavy to properly run on a 2G internet connection. While 4G internet services provide download speed of 150-300 Mbps, 2G internet services only provide download speed of upto 384 Kbps.

Due to denial of 4G internet services, healthcare professionals and ordinary people in Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access the latest information about treatment and management of COVID-19 and relief measures. Further, patients are forced to flock to hospitals, which are hotbeds of infection, to consult doctors about COVID-19 and other ailments. This is because 2G internet services cannot support telemedicine which requires video to visually examine the patient.

In addition to its impact on healthcare, the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir is also preventing children from continuing their education through online tools. Children in the region have already suffered major disruption to their education due to the communication shutdown and lockdown imposed on 05 August 2019 after abrogation of Article 370. The COVID-19 crisis has forced schools to shut down again after re-opening earlier this year.

The government has fully embraced use of technology to combat the pandemic and it has launched a COVID-19 dashboard, WhatsApp chatbot and contact tracing app to widely disseminate accurate and latest information to the public and track spread of the disease. However, at 2G speed, the people of Jammu & Kashmir may be unable to access life saving information through these tools. For instance, the WhatsApp chatbot responds to queries with text, infographics and videos but downloading images and videos is difficult without 4G internet services.

### Hearing before Supreme Court

During today's hearing, a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. issued notice to the standing counsel of Jammu & Kashmir and listed the matter for hearing after one week. This was the same bench which had earlier decided [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/), which related to the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019.

Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi represented the Foundation for Media Professionals during the hearing and we are extremely grateful to him for his efforts. We would also like to thank the wider legal team comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay who worked on this petition. IFF’s Executive Director and Advocate, Apar Gupta was also personally present with the Senior Advocate during today’s hearing which happened via video conferencing.

Thoughts for the night,7,Scheduled,readyplayerone80,fqokhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fqokhh/thoughts_for_the_night/,7,1585445696.0,"I've really been thinking, about how we used to live our lives before lockdown. Everything after lockdown is going to be before lockdown and after lockdown.

Also, honestly, all of us took a lot for granted, didn't we? We had normal lives. Going out for dinner, fancy food, smokes, Chai, hanging out with people, all of that.

Feels like we really took our normal lives for granted and now that feels like a luxury. Like personally if you ask me, if anyone ever makes plans again, I'm never saying no or canceling on them. I definitely am going to be grateful every single time I get to go out and hang out at the places I usually go to. I still have a regular supply of smoke and if I wanted, I could even get my greens. But it's not the same and it's not as fun as smoking at the tapri with a cutting Chai in hand. 

Also, I can't help but think about the regular faces I used to interact with on an almost daily basis while I didn't even know their names. You probably know people like that too. I really hope everyone makes it.

Chandrayaan Moon Landing,501,[R]eddiquette,freddledgruntbugly,d0ffgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0ffgv/chandrayaan_moon_landing/,1434,1567798373.0,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

I finally convinced him. That awesome moment when you understand the essense of life,1894,[R]eddiquette,ruptured_time,d0em6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0em6s/i_finally_convinced_him_that_awesome_moment_when/,184,1567793056.0,"A little long story.  I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words. 

Name of boy - Ivaan

Have a blessed day all!

Sorry for any typos, error.


TLDR- Sorry, cant write in few words.


Update- A kind stranger already pinged me and sent few pics of brand new books and cloths and asking for details as he/she want to send it right away.

How unethical/illegal is my doctor mom's behavior?,420,[R]eddiquette,concernedbrothrowawa,cy9zyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cy9zyu/how_unethicalillegal_is_my_doctor_moms_behavior/,171,1567373691.0,"Mom is a gynecologist by profession. She has ties with some Medical representatives (MRs) where they give her medicine to sell directly at rate cheaper than the shop. She then sells that medicine to patients directly or sends them to the medical shop. Shopkeeper gives her all the money sold from the medicines back.

 She once showed me a brochure which contained different gifts based on number of tablets written . It was a Plasma TV for something like 8,500 tablets but she chose something else.

She also does this thing where she sends a 50rs injection to the medical shop (which dad owns but rents out to others) and writes  a different injection name on prescription paper worth Rs. 5,000. Patient pays 5k to shopkeeper who then brings the money, injection back to her. 

She was really frustrated when they introduced compulsory attendance of certain number of medical conferences per year for doctors. Luckily, MRs get the certificates of conferences for her so she doesn't have to attend a single one! She stores some medicines directly in the medical shop that MRs giver her which she writes and the shop owner gives some commission to her for them.

 She has tie ups with a pathologist, where every patient she refers to him, he gives certain amount of money back to her (like 30%) from his fees. Once, she was showing me pathologist's report for fun to read. I found value of platelet written - 45,000 and underline under it. Normal value written next to it was 150k I think. She said without even looking its 450k, read again. I double checked but nope it was 45,000. She looked at it and got very furious. She immediately called the pathologist and said how dare he didn't tell her immediately and only underline it for her. She said that patient would have gotten serious if not died with that low platelet count. She said, she will instead send all patients to a different pathologist who gives her more cashback from now on if he does something like this again. 

Once a civil surgeon came to check her records and she had them badly incomplete. I remember she was facing removal of her sonography machine at least. Luckily, dad went to meet the civil surgeon few times and paid him around ~1L to keep queit. Mom was complaining how stupid these records are, how much work she has to already do. How unfair this all is on her.

Mom casually mentioned she failed final year of her MBBS but dad paid a lecturer to pass her. How her diploma doesn't mean anything because it is from a non certified organization; but it has the same initials as the official diploma so people would get fooled into thinking she has one.


GORE AHEAD - Parents Hospital is on ground floor and we live upstairs. Growing up, I used to regularly see different meat like parts in a regular dustbin, next to her operation theater. Once a stray dog was eating what looked like placenta from the dustbin. She would pay money to some midwife to dispose off fetuses and bury them into ground somewhere secluded. She was pretty mad when someone complained about her throwing bio hazardous waste in the surrounding area which did she used to do I think.

She reminds me without fail regularly how much money she earns and how many people recognize her outside because she is doctor. How much respect doctors get in society. She would say would say none gets as much respect as doctors do. Once we were going for a family vacation and a bike going at speed got slammed by a car right in front of us. I asked dad shouldn't we stop and help them, aren't you guys doctors and are supposed to help?"" Dad said, ""Who is going to spend that much time taking him to nearest hospital? The guy is probably very serious if not dead already."" So, we chose to continue to our trip.

E: I never meant it as some sort of PSA.  It was more of a venting from my childhood memories . Mom has been very abusive to me and recalling those memories; I have lot of amnesia around them and it is very stressful, anxiety inducing. Its easy to type these ones out because they don't involve me. 

Also they might seem clear to you guys, but I have lived in that home for 21 years. My first memories are formed  while living with my mom. This is quite the norm in my house and I was exposed to only these values, culture, environment most of my life. Parents wouldn't let me go outside much either, I was suicidal for a long time.

*Via [ Indian Express | Explained: What has changed in Jammu and Kashmir ](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-article-370-has-not-been-scrapped-but-kashmirs-special-status-has-gone-5880390/)*

In effect, the state of Jammu and Kashmir will now cease to exist; it will be replaced by two new Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. UTs have become states earlier; **this is the first time that a state has been converted into a UT.** The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have an Assembly, like in Delhi and Puducherry. The UT of Ladakh will not, like Chandigarh.

So, not only has Jammu and Kashmir lost its special status, it has been given a status lower than that of other states.

It is also likely that corporates and individuals will be able to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir. Non-Kashmiris might now get jobs in Kashmir. A process of demographic change might begin, and progress over the coming decades.

# Indian Opinion

Writing in the [Indian Express |  The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal  ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-kashmir-article-370-scrapped-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-bjp-5880797/), Pratap Bahnu Mehta says

>This is a state for whom the only currency that matters is raw power. This is a state that recognises no constraints of law, liberty and morality. This is a state that will make a mockery of democracy and deliberation. This is a state whose psychological principle is fear. This is a state that will make ordinary citizens cannon fodder for its warped nationalist pretensions.

>India has betrayed its own constitutional promises. India has many asymmetric federalism arrangements outside of Kashmir. This act potentially sets the precedent for invalidating all of them. How can we justify offering Nagaland asymmetric federalism but deny it to Kashmir? Its implication is that the government can unilaterally declare any existing state to be a Union Territory. This is a constitutional first. We are simply a union of Union Territories that happen to be a state at the discretion of the Centre.

>What is playing out in Kashmir is the warped psyche of a great civilisation at its insecure worst. The BJP thinks it is going to Indianise Kashmir. **But, instead, what we will see is potentially the Kashmirisation of India: The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal.**

Writing in [The Wire | Constitution Torn to Shreds as RSS Indulges Article 370 Fantasy in Kashmir](https://thewire.in/politics/constitution-torn-to-shreds-as-rss-indulges-article-370-fantasy-in-kashmir) Siddharth Varadarajan says

>Not only has Union home minister Amit Shah stripped Article 370 of its essence, he has gone one step further and abolished the entire state as well, replacing it with two ‘Bantustans’ – grandly called ‘union territories’ – in which key decisions on a range of issues like law and order and land will be taken not by the people and their elected representatives, but by bureaucrats from New Delhi.

>Except, J&K has already enjoyed the rigours of Central rule for nearly 10 of the past 45 years, and has turned out none the better for it. The last 12 months have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself calling the shots, through the president and governor, but the situation there continues to be even worse than it was when the BJP helped run the state government along with the People’s Democratic Party from 2015 to 2018.

>Make no mistake about this – what Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have unveiled on Monday is not just an assault on the unique place that Jammu and Kashmir enjoys in India but on the very federal structure of the Indian constitution. If they spent their first term in office undermining a whole host of institutions, Modi 2.0 will target the one institution that was still somewhat intact – federalism.

Writing in the [Indian Express |  We are just at the beginning](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/article-370-kashmir-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-govt-5880796/) Imad Ul Riyaz says

>My appreciation for India, and that of many other Kashmiris, and the desire to stand by it in the face of hostility and bullying back home, was sustained by the Constitution. Today, we are dejected, appalled and feel betrayed. The issue is not just about the abrogation of Article 370 — it is about the unconstitutional manner in which the exercise is being carried out, the way national and international treaties have been violated. Most importantly, it is about the manner in which the views of the people of Jammu and Kashmir were ignored.

Writing in the [Washington Post | Modi’s Kashmir gamble may be good politics, but peace should be the ultimate goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/05/modis-kashmir-gamble-may-be-good-politics-peace-should-be-ultimate-goal/) Barkha Dutt says

>Yet this serious gamble for the future of Kashmir — which could either be a game-changer or set back peace-building efforts by several years — plays politically well for Modi and his home minister and second-in-command, Amit Shah. For one, it pleases Modi’s core base and delivers on an old promise (the ruling BJP’s manifesto had always promised to implement this). Also, with the exception of only a handful, most political parties have backed the government for what it has called the “integration of Kashmir into the mainstream.“

>The Modi government has scored a political victory. But will it alter the course of the 29-year-old insurgency in the Kashmir valley? One of the most worrisome aspects of the last few hours has been how the government has treated mainstream Kashmiri politicians as if they were anti-national separatists. Many of them braved great dangers and faced great pressure to contest elections and maintain allegiance to the Indian state. Weakening them further — one leader told me the latest move “reduces them to zero” — raises questions about who the government opens a dialogue process with should the time come.

What is a below average guy to do?,265,[R]eddiquette,Voyager910,czk7kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czk7kj/what_is_a_below_average_guy_to_do/,157,1567629032.0,"In my opinion I'm a below average person. Appearance wise I consider myself unlovely. Instead of leaning on euphemism to make the truth palatable I'll state unabashedly that I'm short and ugly.

I was born to a family of modest means. Since childhood I've never been an exceptional performer at school. Probably featured in the bottom few. Not that I was indolent. Despite my best efforts seldom did I perform better than the average.

I followed the herd and ended up studying engineering. Now that I'm trying to look for jobs hardly anyone is interested in me as I'm unexceptional. In this brutally competitive world can someone as vanilla as me attain great success? Repeated rejection in romantic life, professional life has eroded my self belief. 

I had a suspicion ever since I was in my early teens that I was unintelligent. It'd take me a much longer time to grasp a concept compared to my peers. Initially it did bother me but then I developed a thicker skin. My parents also are concerned about my future. Just wanted to let it out.",2019-09-05 02:00:32

Today I walked in a little early at around 6 PM. When I entered the gym, the first thing I heard was an older lady telling me to get out. I replied excuse me, as I was genuinely confused. To which she pointed at the door and said get out in a louder harsher tone. This really irked me and I confronted her and asked her to talk politely to which she said gym has ladies time from 4 PM to 7 PM. I told her there is no such rule written anywhere and asked her to show me proof. To this, she replied to go talk to the manager. I told her since it's her claim, she should show me proof to which she said don't argue, just get out. I told her even I can bring a couple of guys in the gym and tell you, people, that this is gents hour if I don't have proof, to which she shouted even more loudly saying don't talk back and asked me to get out. I just scoffed and proceeded to walk to my workout station where she physically stopped me and said something like such mannerless youth come here nowadays. I replied saying, I am just asking a question, which I have the right to and proceeded to my workout station by walking around her.

I think this hurt her ego, and she went and called the manager. When the manager came, she told him I was rude to her and was harassing her physically (her claim was I pushed her and went) and her aunty squad was backing her up. In fact, this woman had grabbed my hand and tried to physically stop me from entering and now was accusing me of me abusing her verbally and pushing her. This is when I really wanted to whack her, but knowing how the law works it would have gone to her favor. Luckily, some other women in the gym stood up for me and said I didn't do anything but ask her for proof of the rule to which the aunty replied something akin to us accusing her of lying (which she was). When she knew she wasn't going to win this, she started demanding an apology from me, which I obviously refused. This is when she abused me some more and said something on the lines of aaj kal ke ye bacche and left while threatening me she will handle me later. I think that's when the manager realized the lady was full of shit. He then calmly explained to me about the new gym timing rules. I told him, if she would have politely asked me to leave and shown me the new rule, I would have left. I just confronted her because she was extremely rude to me for no reason. 

Dunno where this entitlement comes from in these old fucks. Just because they are old, they think they can get away with anything.

**Tl;dr: I was accused of verbal and physical abuse by some old aunty because I asked her a question and got saved by some women in my gym.**



**Edit: Manager took the blame in the end and apologized for that, to which I said that's fine. This rule was instated some 3 days ago and was apparently sent to everyone in the building Whatsapp group (which I am not a part of since my brother owns the flat). So the lady had a physical copy of the rule on her. But she didn't want to show it to me because elders should be listened to without any questions. I told the manager to please post it on the door or something so something like this doesn't happen again. I also told him, the only reason I got irked was that the lady was being really rude and downright abusive.**",2019-07-31 05:41:00

But I would like to point out that it is infact increasing the problem, not solving it. We are trained to see a single woman only either as a sister, or a mother, or a wife, but never in the form of a lover or as as individual in herself (terming sister,mother,wife attaches a relationship with someone, depriving them of their own identity). Even take the case of Radha, she was lover of Krishna, but she is most commonly worshiped as Radhe Maiya. 

This has to change, women should be seen as her own entity, not as someone's Mother or Sister or Wife.

I don't feel a thing except for a minute or two.

>India had informed about Counter Terrorism (CT) action it took yesterday against a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan based on credible evidence that JeM intended to launch more attacks. Against this Counter Terrorism Action, Pakistan has responded this morning by using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side. Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan’s attempts were foiled successfully.

>The Pakistan Air Force was detected and the Indian Air Force responded instantly. In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side. In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts.

* Indian Air Force officer addresses first. Pakistan Air Force planes were intercepted. In the aerial combat, one F-16 aircraft was shot down by an IAF MiG Bison. IAF lost one MiG, he says and refers to the capture of the IAF pilot. 
* Pakistan resorted to indiscriminate firing on Feb. 26 and was befittingly retalitated.  Given the high level of preparedness Pak designs were foiled.  We are in a heightened state of alert, he (Army Maj. Gen Bahal) says. 
* Navy remains poised in all three dimensions to defeat Pakistan's provocations. 
* AVM Kapoor says piece of evidence is being presented about the aircraft being used by Pakistan based on electronic signature.  Pakistan media reports showing engine parts were not of MiG 21s, he says adding that it could be concluded that F-16s were used.

I knew about Jio deep packet inspection and blocking but it wasn't much of a concern to me as I didn't mean they got direct access to my network devices.

However that changed after I got it installed and running today. Basically the router is locked down. You can't use non Jio routers to connect, there's no username / password settings to use for another non Jio router.

The biggest security issue is your Jio router can be managed by my Jio app like changing SSID, password, blocking device etc and it works even remotely (outside your WiFi network). So the only thing stopping a attacker is myjio authentication which I'm sure can be cracked. Moreover if they get access to network from Jio side, they can literally do anything. Run exploits against your networked devices etc.

And remote management is disabled by default so there's no way to stop myjio app access.

Tldr: Jio have full remote access to your router and network.",2019-09-05 03:11:59

I live in a major city in a nondescript location. My building is dilapidated. I had a family but now I've no one. I leave for work at 8 am and return at 9 pm. There's no one one waiting for my return. If I were to stop existing I suspect no one would care. There was a point in my life that the absence of a family hurt me.


But now I'm numb. I'm in a sea of humanity but alone in the boat. My eyes go moist on seeing others celebrating life's little victories with their families.


A distant relative of mine to silence my litany of complaints about life advised me to visit a counsellor. I did that. Other than receiving some impracticable advice I learned nothing.
My soul is disembodied. It wouldn't be wrong to say I'm a living corpse. I force a smile to be polite when I see people. But a little part of me dies on doing so. I too wish to be loved, to be wanted.

I spend quite a lot of time working with the less privileged. I do as much as I can. But that doesn't give my life a purpose. My life has gone from being variecoloured to monochromatic to colourless.

You don’t need to pay bribes to the cops if you follow all the rules !,70,[R]eddiquette,akhil4eva,czw0av,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czw0av/you_dont_need_to_pay_bribes_to_the_cops_if_you/,135,1567686606.0,"Over the past few days, people I know and some people here are complaining over the new and increased hefty fines imposed upon breaking rules while driving. The major point which people were saying was this “Bigger fines means more money in the cops’ pocket”. So my take is why even give them a chance to give them a challan let alone take a bribe from you. If all of the rules are followed, there’s absolutely no way you can be issued a challan or even try be asked for a bribe. If they still do, I’m pretty sure you can actually take strict action against them. Don’t even give them a chance to ask for a bribe ! 
Drive safe guys and have a good day. 
PS : Happy Teachers Day

PPS : Sorry to hear so many of you still get fined even if you follow the rules. Seems like you have a pretty terrible share of cops compared to where I live. But still I stand by this. If because of these increased fines, even if a few % of people start to follow the rules when they previously didn’t, that would be satisfactory.

I was close to my nani and I cant take this disrespect. Its the 6th day everyone apart from my Mom, her brother and Nana doesnt even care anymore, they just keep joking and fucking around, then distant relatives come and abuse my Nana for more money and stupid things he ""must do"" like organize food and shit for 200+ people, give away gifts like glasses/jugs to all relatives.. ??? what the fuck man. This is from Rajasthan if someone is wondering. Is there nothing I can do to stop this bullshit?

Edit- What im getting at is, most of the stuff people do at funerals(atleast in my region) is to ""show"" others how much they care(even if they genuinely dont care someone died).

It's not easy to be Atheist in India,59,[R]eddiquette,I_can_believe_that,d1orek,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d1orek/its_not_easy_to_be_atheist_in_india/,80,1568051588.0,"And by that I didn't mean you'll be lynched by your parents for coming out as an atheist, they'll be disappointed at best or won't understand you at all. But that's not the main problem here, the main problem is it's very difficult to criticize Hinduism. Unlike other major religions Christianity and Islam, Hinduism suffers from a dissociative identity disorder. Many people argue that it's *a way of life* or *a cultural identity* unique to the sub-continent and not a mainstream religion. But in reality, it's very evidently a religion. When someone questions the verses of the holy scriptures, the best reply they get is *'Oh! we Hindus don't follow our scriptures very strictly like the Muslims & Christians*'. When someone questions certain practices in Hinduism they blame it on the culture, tradition & society, even if they are the ones who said Hinduism is a way of life, not simply a religion. This double standard confuses many young people trying to question their faiths and in the end, they give up and reconcile themselves believing that Hinduism is not completely evil like other western religions. Many people still can't comprehend the evils of the caste system and how it has affected the lives of the lower caste communities for thousands of years. Even I was living in denial, back when I was a kid I believed that the *varna system* in Hinduism is not evil and the evil caste system was created by the British. At least that's what I was taught when I first questioned that system.

Many smart Hindus argue that you can be an atheist and still be Hindu because there were many ancient atheistic schools in India, like the *Charvaka*. But the thing is Charvaka was an exception in Hinduism, not the rule. Many other ancient cultures were quite similar too, who were absolutely materialistic and atheistic. Claiming that they were all modern secular humanists who considered nothing but science would be even more wrong. There's nothing common between modern-day atheism and those ancient cultures except disbelief in supernatural. I still don't get how someone is a modern-day atheist and still be a Hindu culturally or otherwise.",2019-09-09 23:23:08

I went to the counter to pay as usual. There were two people in front of me, an elderly man and a woman in her 30s. As the woman was paying, the elderly man cut the line to get something he forgot. While he was gone, the woman finished her transaction and left. It took another 20 seconds for him to return. I stood there along with another woman behind me out of courtesy for the old man.  When he returned, seeing us waiting, he apologized and thanked us. We greeted him and smiled back. Fair enough

Now it was my turn, as I was reaching to my pocket, 'backassward-ly"" a young man in his teens enters the shop, grabs himself a loaf of bread and stands right in front of me. I froze for a second. It was the most extraordinary transition to an ""unexplored territory"". The cashier herself was visibly irritated. She told him that she was attending to me and that he should fall back in line just like everyone else. He smirked and stood behind; in between the lady and me. I couldn't handle his behavior and flipped. I said to his face, what he was doing was wrong and he should have the least courtesy towards other customers. He had that look in the face which completely describes and ghetto teen filled with cynicism and packed with attitude. 

The woman behind me told me to calm down and let him get over with. I paid for my shit and left.

As I reflect now, there is one thing I realize. If we wish to change the country for the better, it should start from us. At the end of the day, you can only change yourself.

Italy recently has its own political crisis after an uneasy coalition collapsed because of the racist Home Minister's party being a fifth column in government.

Brexit is happening because closeted xenophobic sentiments have been exploited in full. France nearly elected a xenophobe in Marine Le Pen as its President.

Austria had a semi-hardliner as its chancellor not too many months ago.

Hungary and several other EU border states hate immigrants.

Poland is turning hard-liner after its government tried to mess with the independence of its judiciary.

It is well known that the fat cats of the middle east are deeply involved in any conflicts in the region.

Duterte of the Philippines rose to power on the drugs bogeyman, taking the law into his own hands and running a bloody pogrom against anyone he believed to be a drug peddler.

Putin is widely accused of influencing elections in many adversary states (read: pro-US states) and his government also cracks down on political opposition within Russia.

Ukraine turned into a political tug-of-war between Russia and the West.

Underdeveloped Central and North African nations like Sudan, Nigeria and Somalia continue to be pretty unstable.

Brazil's president is Trump's protege on environmental matters.

Within Asia, Imran Khan's party was largely seen as a hard-line pro-Islam party, although his election platform was focused more on corruption by Nawaz Sharif.

Even in India, BJP's election platform subtly switched from development to pseudo-nationalism, as was always predicted by anyone with half a brain. The worst part is people lapped it up and gave Modi a thumping majority, bigger than his previous one! He's used it to stifle the opposition and captured the media.

My question would amuse them and surprise them, and  then, not knowing exactly what to answer, they would look at  each other and at me. I persisted in my questioning. At last a 
vigorous Jat, wedded to the soil from immemorial generations,  would say that it was the dharti, the good earth of India, that  they meant. What earth? Their particular village patch, or all  the patches in the district or province, or in the whole of India?  And so question and answer went on, till they would ask me  impatiently to tell them all about it. I would endeavour to do 
so and explain that India was all this that they had thought,  but it was much more. The mountains and the rivers of India, 
and the forests and the broad fields, which gave us food, were  all dear to us, but what counted ultimately were the people of 
India, people like them and me, who were spread out all over  this vast land. Bharat Mata, Mother India, was essentially these 
millions of people, and victory to her meant victory to these  people. You are parts of this Bharat Mata, I told them, you are

My original plan was to crack CAT but couldn't clear it. Tried 2 times but to no avail. 

Now 2 years have passed and I've done nothing basically (although I did brush up some coding here and there, but nothing on paper) .

I have just started coding again, started with cs50 on edx but still feel bad considering I am 24 and still learning the basics. and god knows how would I explain that 2 year gap.

I am also somewhat depressed as my friends are working on 10 lpa+ jobs whilst I'm still at at big 0.

If that helps I have 80% in 10th & 12th, and 7.3 CGPA in my grad. 

Looking for some advice as how to follow through so that I could end up with a decent job.

I am in deep regret, & I am ready to work my ass off. I really want to ctach up to my classmates, even better them but I don't know how. 

Any help is appreciated. Also Is it a good idea to cover it up with a fake startup? I mean I could create a website and show it as my 2 year work? Can they catch me? If not, Any other advice? 

Should I go freelancing ot hunt for job, I live in Indore if it may help.

My dream is to get into some big product based company. I am willing to do any amount of work for that.

Thanks for listening folks. If anyone had a similar phase let me know.

Edit : I think people mistook me for not liking coding. I'd like to clarify that I didn't ever dug up coding, I was naive so didn't knew much, was lazy so didn't tried much either. Now that I've started learning programming seriously, I love it.

So, please don't think I am doing coding because I'm desperate. I actually want to do it. My concerns are how to cover up my 2 year gap and get back on track.

Lost my virginity and I am unsure of my feelings.,40,[R]eddiquette,98Uhu,cxk0xm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cxk0xm/lost_my_virginity_and_i_am_unsure_of_my_feelings/,49,1567214653.0,"Have posted this elsewhere, posting it here because I think an Indian audience will relate more with a fellow Indian.

Background: I(M24) have been with my girlfriend(F24) for around 1 and a half year now. Our relationship isn't the most stable, my GF has anger issues and I am not the most easily forgiving person either. We fight quite a bit. A few weeks ago, after a major fight my girlfriend told me ""let's not commit right now, let's see each other but not commit"" I was okay with that, I don't really love her or anything, and I keep thinking about other women all the time. Additionally, I'm a virgin while she's had a relationship before and lost her virginity in that. I've always wanted to have my first time with a girl I actually loved and cared about, and possibly was married to.

We've made out in the past. Indulged in some fingering but that was it. Today, we decided to meet for a short while in our favorite spot where we always do. We sat and talked. Long story short, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Being my first time, it was all over in 5-7 minutes. After I was finished, I sat there in a daze. My GF asked for water and wanted to clean up. I sat there, as if I'd been stupefied. It took her repeating herself thrice before I paid attention to her.

Even as I type this, it is very difficult for me to come to terms with my feelings about the entire affair. Even after we bid each other goodbye and I walked to my apartment, I walked in a daze, where I was mechanically doing everything without really thinking about it. I looked around and I literally had trouble perceiving the world. Its like, I took in the sights and sounds but my brain wasn't processing them.

I feel no joy. I feel no happiness that I had sex barely 2 hours ago. All I feel is a void, where some sense of gratification should be. I don't love this girl. We fight so much. And who knows what complications this might lead to. I want some love, I want to be able to look into a woman's eyes and know she's the one for me as I have sex with her. I don't feel this way about my current gf. And I hate this feeling. This is why I had refused to have sex with her so far. I have never felt so distant from her as I do right after having had sex with her. This is a bad sign, right?

I don't want to say she made me do it. True, it was she who took her pants off and pulled me towards her, and guided my penis inside her. True, but I was there . I could have stopped her. And she probably wouldn't have resisted. I did not. I could have said no, but for some reason I didn't. I don't want to pretend like I was forced into sexual activity. I was there with my consent.

She is very happy about us finally having sex. I am not. It just feels wrong.

I feel like I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but IDK. I'm not sure who to turn to with this. I'm a man. I'll probably be told to shut up and be happy i'm getting action. But I don't feel happy about this. How do I come to terms with my feelings?",2019-08-31 06:54:13

He had 88 cases against him which included rape, murder, attempt to murder, gangrapes, extortion, etc. in the last 14 years.",1332,[R]eddiquette,7xbvt,bqu5mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bqu5mh/til_in_2004_around_200_women_barged_in_a_nagpur/,130,1558379391.0,"Sept.

When hundreds of women descended on Nagpur district court armed with knives, stones and chilli powder, within minutes the man who raped them lay dead. Raekha Prasad reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/16/india.gender)

> At 3pm on August 13 2004, Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar. It took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. As he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. A further 70 stab wounds were left on his body. The incident was made all the more extraordinary by its setting. Yadav was murdered not in the dark alleys of the slum, but on the shiny white marble floor of Nagpur district court.

> Laughed at and abused by the police when they reported being raped by Yadav, the women took the law into their own hands. A local thug, Yadav and his gang had terrorised the 300 families of Kasturba Nagar for more than a decade, barging into homes demanding money, shouting threats and abuse.

> Residents say he murdered at least three neighbours and dumped their bodies on railway tracks. They had reported his crimes to the police dozens of times. Each time he was arrested, he was granted bail.

> He violated women to control men, ordering his henchmen to drag even girls as young as 12 to a nearby derelict building to be gang-raped.

>  Prominent among their supporters were 100 lawyers based in Nagpur who issued a statement saying the women should not be treated as the accused, but as the victims. 

> *One retired high court judge even congratulated the women. ""In the circumstances they underwent, they were left with no alternative but to finish Akku. The women repeatedly pleaded with the police for their security. But the police failed to protect them,"" said Justice Bhau Vahane.*

> On the day of Yadav's hearing, 200 women came to the court armed with vegetable knives and chilli powder. *As he walked in, Yadav spotted one of the women he had raped. He called her a prostitute and threatened to repeat the crime against her. The police laughed. She took off her sandal and began to hit him, shouting, ""We can't both live on this Earth together. It's you or me.""*

Such crises appear to the public slowly. I consider the current situation is only first round of crisis.\*

&#x200B;

• Increasing the NPA of banks means. Scarcity of capital which means no fresh investment. The glorification of bankrupt law and Continuous scams in companies

• Homes are not being sold which means sale of  steel, cement, bathroom fittings, construction declining. With this banks NPAs will grow. These NPAs go deep into individual level by making the crisis deeper,

• Vehicle sales are declining. At present first time in the country sale of  two wheelers are showing negative growth. Maruti has cut down production by 50%. Many of the auto dealers are closing down. This means  there is substantial reduction demand for steel, tyre and other accessories.

&#x200B;

The above three things are meant to be the end of the crores of jobs and the reduction of government's tax revenues. In such a situation, the government becomes frustrated and wants to complete its loss by putting taxes on everything, The government hands over the profits in private hands and puts the deficit in the government account. In such a situation, the government properties are sold in multiples of their favorite corporate and the losses increase.

For the past few years, even the  FMCG sector is  also in the  grip of recession-. Do you remember  when you have  last seen Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Company's advertisement?  Patanjali was most active on TV about 2 years back., but for last one year, the condition of even Patanjali  which grew at the fastest pace in India's FMCG market is alarming.. Sales of Patanjali's products is shrinking.  Apart from this, Patanjali Ayurveda has shown 10% Revenue Deficit in FY 2018. Not only companies such as Patanjali but Hindustan Lever also have come down in growth. Demand for fast-selling consumer goods such as soap, toothpaste, hair oil, biscuits etc. has decreased considerably in rural areas. This has also slowed down the performance of those businesses, which are dependent on healthy rural demand. It includes FMCG, two-wheeler and auto companies that make entry-level cars.

Now come on the transport-According to the  report of the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training,  15% drop in truck rentals has reported since November 2018.  Also Fleet Utilization has dropped more than that. All 75 trunk routes, rentals have gone down substantially. Between April and June, Fleet Utilization has decreased 25% to 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. This also reduces the income of transporters by about 30%. Many operators may also come in the Fleet's EMI default in the next quarter.

There is a clear impact on the freight demand because of reduction in industrial production. Demand from the manufacturing sector, which contributes the most to truck transport, is at minimum level. Consumers spending in cities and rural areas have reduced and transportation in agriculture has almost become sluggish after the peak demand of April. In June, the demand for fruits and vegetables by FMCG has decreased by 20%.

Due to the decrease of the freight demand, truck fleet has reduced by 30% on all major routes of the country in the first quarter.",2019-08-08 05:56:54

So many consultancies are trying to dupe students/freshers looking for jobs. This is what happened to me.,308,[R]eddiquette,akki95,c84t0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c84t0z/so_many_consultancies_are_trying_to_dupe/,65,1562070737.0,"I am looking for a job while currently pursuing my masters. Since i graduated in economics with no technical skills in hand, the majority of jobs being offered to me are crappy BPO and backend ones. 

Me and my friend who's in the same boat decided to apply on job portals and we start getting all sorts of calls hiring for voice/non voice process. Some of them were bonafide but i think, majority of them were from fraud consultancies. I got an offer for an interview in Delhi's Badarpur and accepted to come for the interview. The day before, i was wondering that nothing good has ever happened in Badarpur and did a quick google search only to find a consumer complaint filed against the 'consultancy' that i was going to. 

A few days later, me and my friend got another offer for an interview in two consultancies that were in very close proximity to each other. We, being the idiots we are, forget to double check and went to the agencies the next day. I, although asked everything about any hidden charges and ofcourse she lied.


The one i went to made me wait for about half an hour for the interview, i have given interviews before and knew this is not how it works. *Mujhe pata chal gaya tha mera chutiya kat chuka hai.* The interviewer was hardly 10th pass who was struggling to ask questions in English and the moment she uttered i can offer you 35k, i knew this is a scam and she's about to ask me for money which she did. There's no way i can get 35k even if i sold my body to a pimp. So i stormed out of there and called my friend.


What happened with him is more interesting, when they asked him for money, he got himself out by saying he need some time to think. He went down to smoke and he saw three police officers marching towards the building. The moment they saw my friend they asked ""how much were they asking?"". My friend replied 10k but he gave them nothing. He showed them the way inside the building.


So my friend was sitting outside the room where the interviews took place watching the entire raid taking place. A BTech graduate who paid 2k rupees as 'security' to the the frauds comes after giving a ""telephonic interview"" and says to my friend *bhut tough interview tha, aadhe ghante grill kia*. The police officer shouted from inside *koi interview nahi tha, iska pati hai vo*. This poor delusional guy was still under the impression that he'll get the job untill everything was explained to him.  He gave the lady 2k rupees which the police got back from her.



Any adequately informed job seeker who has given at least one interview knows that only frauds asks money from candidates but i guess there are still people who in desperation, will oblige and pay.

I also feel like an idiot for not cross checking this time and believing everything she told me over the phone like no hidden charges etc.


This all happened 2 days ago and i have another interview lined up later today for a fairly good profile (no BPO/backend crap) after clearing an online test for it. It's the real deal and it'll give an okay start to a fresher like me.

That said, i still feel like an idiot that i went there and waited 30 minutes only to get conned.",2019-07-02 18:02:17

Of the things I heard,What triggered him to commit this bold act was the extensive abuse by the higher officials of my college.I honestly think they went too far with their punishments.First they snatched his phone,called his parents and abused him over the phone(on live call).He cried for hours.The abuse was too critical he hit his limit.Standing for 5 hours,abused every constant minute by professors and HOD,Removing him from placements,Breaking up with his girlfriend ,Exam pressure and losing his parents' trust.Later the HOD wouldn't give back his phone and informed that he will return it once he clears all his arrears.Unsure of what to do,he took the easy way out.This is the first time such an act is taking place in my college.Needless to say everyone is shocked.Who am i to say what must he have been through?But I do know he was depressed and had been abused.This all happened so fast it went by like a breeze,I really don't know man.....Is verbal and mental abuse the only way to punish students?! Why do these professors have such inflated egos?! Why are authoritarian ideals praised and enforced on young, innocent minds?! I really don't want these questions to be answered for which a life could have been saved.If only me or my friends weren't so naive about it we could have did something....something to help him.Sucide is a bitch,So if any of you have friends going through a tough situation.Take immediate action don't wait before it's too late.

Serious replies only, please.

Hi,

I live in a 1RK on the top floor of a resident house, there are only 2 1RKs on the top floor. A single bachelor girl is moving to 
one of the 1RKs. My house owner (who occupied 2 floors) is now living on an other city, so its going to be only 2 of us in the entire building most of the time.

I am mostly scared of the worst possible scenario like any false accusations or any problems and with the law leaning towards women, will the society blame me ? I am a bachelor as well, this makes the problem even more scarier. I don't know any thing about that girl, but I am just in paranoia.


I am mostly inclined towards staying, as there are no water problems here, that's the main reason she is moving in.

Am I putting myself in a vulnerable position staying there ? or should I just move out of it ?",2019-07-18 06:05:43

Arushi is the sole occupant of her flat which is on the 4th floor and her only floor neighbour is a drunk, pervert 50 year old, let's call him Manu. The balconies and windows of the two flats are adjacent so whatever is loud enough at Manu's flat, is audible at Arushi's. He likes to sit at his balcony and yell curses about what not and initially, it was just random stuff he's pissed about and his language is the foulest you can imagine, copulating with people's mothers, etc. He tried to initiate conversations multiple times with Arushi but she, of course, avoided him the best she could. She even spoke to Manu personally, very politely about how she finds his language excruciatingly foul and requested him not to do that. Then soon enough, the yelling and cursing quickly descended down to expressing his sexual desires for her in the cheapest ways you can imagine (she even hesitates to describe the exact stuff he says). This will go on for hours on end, every other day. As if this wasn't enough, he will have his merry brand of fellow perverts and get drunk at his flat who all will come and knock at Arushi's door to make things even more difficult for her. Eventually, she went to the police once, they just left the guy with a warning. The events continued, she went to the police the second time, the cops came to the guy's place and left after a bit more serious warning. And then the events continued (the warnings seem to have no effect on him), and one night, when the scenario remained on resume, she had to call the cops and they came and took the drunks away and they were back soon enough again (seemingly, they again, had been just left with some threats and let loose once they were sober). And now they are back at it, yet again. These events span the duration of 3-4 months and obviously, Arushi doesn't feel safe at all having to live in perpetual fear when she has to leave or enter her room having to come across the douchebags, drunk, with their door left wide open. Since the official police warnings have had no effect and even the police doesn't seem to care enough, we are clueless on what to do about this. Woman helplines, reachout centers, the right people to talk to? Any sort of leads or help is appreciated.
Thank you.

Update (after a week since the original post): She got to know Manu had been drunk in his room and dropped to the floor along with his fridge and tomato'd his skull. She lived 4-5 days without knowing there was a dead body the next door. His brother / sister were here to clean up and perform the rituals over the weekend and they apologized to Arushi for what she was put through and commended for having been brave (apparently they knew but didn't / couldn't do anything about it because reasons she didn't want to find out further). Was not expecting that closure. Thank you all for having suggested and helped us.

If you have the urge to prove that you are not impotent so bad , get your sperm or womb tested and get the doctor's certificate and place it at your living room wall or office space so you can show people this if you want to prove to them that you are not having kids because of choice. 

If you don't care about these things, just have kids when you are ready. Its also perfectly fine to not have kids too if that's what you want. There are too people in our country and it will be good we don't bring unwanted kids into this world.

Assam floods: Let us stand by our state in these dire times,414,[R]eddiquette,hardshock,ce79ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce79ay/assam_floods_let_us_stand_by_our_state_in_these/,26,1563361937.0,"Hi, a lot of us may not be aware, but the situation of the Assam floods is quite grim. Year after year, we have faced the brunt and came back and rebuild our state, and as such, may have become oblivious for the national media to cover our situation. Most of us are still unaware of the situation that our state has to go through every year, worse than the floods that have occurred in the other states, due to the lack of the limelight in the national media.

All this aside, it is just a humble request from me to all to just stand by our state at this perilous hour, as we stood by together during the recent Chennai or Kerala floods.

&#x200B;

Kindly urge you to donate, whatever the capacity, as it will go a long way in rebuilding our state back to normalcy and help save the lives of lakhs of people.

Here are a few links that you can donate to:

PAYTM: [https://paytm.com/helpinghand/assam-chief-minister-s-relief-fund](https://paytm.com/helpinghand/assam-chief-minister-s-relief-fund)

I have personally bared the brunt of the floods earlier and this is slated as a flood of even greater proportions. Any small contribution will really go a long way! As we can admire the beauty of the North-East, let’s also join hands together to save it!

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time to go through this!

Edit:

For those of you who are either residing outside India or do not want to contribute to the CM Fund, you can contribute to reputable and proven NGO's such as Goonj which I hear is doing brilliant work.

* In the college, didn't appear for placements as I wanted to pursue [M.Tech](https://m.tech/).
* Graduated in July '18, and then procrastinated a lot and couldn't focus well for GATE.
* Got very low score in GATE; couldn't clear it.
* Since the results came out, I have been very depressed. Couldn't focus on academia, and could neither sleep well too. I have grown black heads under the eyes due to intense pressure and feel like a dead man already.
* Also, **the thought of having a gap of 2 years (2018 and 2019) haunts me.** I don't think no good recruiter would hire me even if I have sufficient skills. They would straight away call me incompetent.
* I don't want to be hired for any service-based company. I've heard very bad reviews about them.
* Due to intense depression and mental disorders (Aspergers, ADHD, and OCD), I forgot most of the stuff; and I can't focus well on even basic fundamentals. My brain hurts like hell!
* I can't solve Leetcode problems or the ones on HackerRank and similar platforms: even the easy ones!
* Also, there are a lot of things and so less time! I don't know how I wasted 4 years of engineering.
* The thing that haunts me the most is, no product-based company is gonna hire me seeing a 2-year gap and that I graduated from a private university. Also, the competition is too much here (Due to overpopulation).
* As a result, I can't learn stuff and focus on things. My heart constantly beats faster due to so much of stress.
* I wanna just end my life to free up pain.

The problem of stray cattle is mostly due to old cattle being an economic burden but not led to a butcher house because of cultural and legal issues around cows. There are rarely any stray buffaloes.

It's way too high. The only reason I as an alien individual cannot confront them is that they are known to be fight mongers. Mahn this is disturbing to the core.

The Ganesh Chaturthi season has begun, and this is the time a lot of bands are on the road banging the hell out of a 🥁. Streets get blocked, traffic is affected; boisterous celebrations in all streets with people disrupting the already noisy atmosphere of a city. 

I am not in any way targeting a religion here. Don't digress from the main topic. These ethical values are generic to all faiths. They are universal. 

I would like to take this opportunity and request all those who are undertaking such celebrations to do it by all means, but also take in consideration that their revelries don't create a bad image of their religion/ideology.

The Higher Quality of living argument to go abroad #BrainDrain,11,[R]eddiquette,HarHarGange,cr3qra,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cr3qra/the_higher_quality_of_living_argument_to_go/,36,1565974799.0,"My friend's girlfriend pointBlankly refused to come back to India from Germany. She says 'Quality of life' is better there. She needs to work only 9 to 5 on 5 days a week. There's much less work pressure and lot more salaries. So she planned to never come back. So, my friend also shifted, to save the relationship.

Another friend of mine said that he never got as much sick in US in three years as much as he got in India.

There are also, a lot of 'facilities' in these 'better countries' such as more access to travel to great places.

The people in these countries are also more advanced in thinking, of course, because they are more educated. Unlike the 'Indian society'.

Basically, there's this argument, not the sole argument, but frequently heard of, that European countries or US has better quality of life, and therefore, they don't want to come back to India.

However, the government of India spent money on them, in their education (All of us are from government engineering colleges). The parents have some expectations as well.

How justified is this? And what would be the counter argument to the beautiful picture that is being painted in support of  shifting to better countries?",2019-08-16 22:29:59

"(Story time) 13th Dec, 1971 - The day when Russian Nuclear warheads surfaced on the Bay of Bengal to stop USS Enterprise from attacking India",782,Non-Political,Saap_ka_Baap,fz62ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz62ox/story_time_13th_dec_1971_the_day_when_russian/,192,1586643187.0,"During the 1971 war between India and Pakistan for the liberation of Bangladesh (formerly known as East Pakistan), US and UK sided with Pakistan and sent their warships to India and US. 

On 13th December 1971, US President Nixon redirected the 7th Navy Fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the Bay of Bengal to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promptly called on Moscow to invoke a secret provision in the India-Soviety treaty under which Russia was bound to defend India in case of any external aggression. Russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a Nuclear submarine from Vladivostok on 13th December, 1971 under the command of Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the US Fleet to advance and attack the military bases of India. 

The only thing standing between the US Fleet and the Indian cities was the Indian Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant and the Russian fleet, so India and Russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

As the US Aircraft carrier was entering the Bay of Bengal to attack India, for the first time in human history the Russians decided to intentionally bring their Nuclear submarine to the surface and let the Americans see them.

As soon as the Russian Submarine surfaced on the Bay of Bengal, the US Admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'We are too late, the Russians are already here'
The mere fact of seeing Russian nuclear warheads in the Bay of Bengal changed America's mind and they retreated.

Russia further went on to say 'A war on India will be considered a war on Russia' and threatened China to not join the conflict on orders of the US and threatened to sink Sinkiang (a region in China) if they tried to stop India from liberating Bangladesh.

Ever since then India has considered Russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of Russian weapons and Nuclear Reactors in the world.

That's the reason a Russian president has never set foot in Pakistan.",2020-04-12 03:43:07

101 years of Jallianwala Bagh massacre | Background | Aftermath | Shaheed Uddham Singh [Mega Thread],254,Non-Political,Neglectedsince1994,g0dofi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0dofi/101_years_of_jallianwala_bagh_massacre_background/,56,1586789095.0,"***\*Picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, I've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\****

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200B;

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

Most people that I have seen buying car are the ones spending their entire year salary's equivalent sum of money buying something they don't really need. Some people even spend amount equivalent to their two year's salary on a depreciation asset like car.

I ran numbers in different ways and realised that it's not worth the price you pay. I also found a specific kilometre number (kind of like break even for car usage) if you drive above it annually then it makes sense to go for car otherwise not.

It's easy to get a car when going out with friends or family (zoomcar etc) if you need to commute to office then two wheeler or cabs or autos are sufficient that's what I feel.

I completely understand some people buy car for reasons like status in society, comfort etc. By no means am against them, just sharing what I think.

My Covid-19 quarantine experience,1950,Non-Political,21dec1989,ffyots,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,158,1583805274.0,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 

If you have symptoms, report yourself.",2020-03-10 07:24:34

Idiots think that my poor cat causes corona and gave 2 of my 5 cats away. Bastards. My grandma straight up kicked my cat and called it bastard. I told her indirectly to never come to my house. These stupid ‘ustads’ (muslim priests) make some videos on YouTube saying shit like this , which my granny listens to and tells the rest of my family who like fools agree with what she says. “Chickens,goats and cats” cause corona it seems. I asked her, people have been having these animals for millennia. And my cat is an indoor cat for god sake. I’m not very religious but my family has turned into some cult right now. Full time these Islamic speeches will be played in YouTube at full volume which irritates the shit out of me. They are in Arabic too, my family doesn’t even know Arabic , they think listening to it will bless us and protect us or some shit. My mom posts all this religious stuff and saying allah is the best and some of those sentences sometimes make it seem like she’s in a cult and totally brainwashed. It also affects my dads business, you know how? Dad and mom works together as an event company and most of my dads clients are Hindus , who after seeing all this try to stay away. It may sound crazy but there are many clients who have often told other clients not to make events from us since we are biased to Islam. My dad tells my mom not to be so religious atleast in social media where thousands of people will be viewing. It’s kind of like her business number. My moms name sounds very much like a Muslim name so they decided to change it(not officially) to seem neutral to all religions. You ask why go to such extents, it’s just a religion? My dad almost lost an event from a multi millionaire because his friends circle were Hindus and told not to organise event from us. Instead go to other alternative , he stayed with us but guess what happened next? He didn’t pay the amount of the quotation(bill) and flew to Singapore. So that my dad doesn’t call him. And on top of all this shit, now this coronavirus shit happened and they bring religion to all this and I feel like I’m in a cult. I don’t like it, if I’m at home I’m on my PC from morning to night so it’s not a huge problem for me. But since there are holidays for everyone , my mom always takes us to our granny’s house where everyone stays (joint family) , all these people who have jobs are currently staying at home and including the ones who were always jobless are together. It’s a huge cult now, all day I’m asked to pray, every 5 minutes(almost literally) I’m reminded that cats give coronavirus and insults to my cats keep coming. Although there’s clearly NO evidence to it at all. They also say that the world will be wiped out by this virus since it’s written in the Quran or something which I don’t think is true. Sorry for the long rant, it’s not too terrible but it’s pretty bad.",2020-03-21 03:58:26

Now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""What are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""What are some badass tweets during Covid-19"". It's filled with young Indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'.

Opinion: What's the point of being religious if it doesn't rid you of basic human vices?,152,Non-Political,Sulh-i-kul,funn5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/funn5p/opinion_whats_the_point_of_being_religious_if_it/,45,1586004733.0,"One of my neighbours and their family are super religious. They conduct loud Pujas during Navratra, twice a day. They conduct havans, Jaaps, Jagrata et al regularly, sometime even multiple times a month. Our family does that too, but not as often or at the same scale as them. 

When they're not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, I can hear them yell at each other - ALL DAY LONG. They call each other names to the extent that'd make a road rag blush. Nobody in our building, therefore, likes them one bit - they're a nuisance not only to each other, but to other families in the building too, many of whom have impressionable little children.

This made me think - What's the point of following any religion if it doesn't bring you an iota of peace or doesn't rid you of basic vices of jealousy, intolerance, harm to the fellow human, and lack of empathy in general? What would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day?

I realised (definitely just a bit of it) yesterday how creepy we Indian men are .,230,Non-Political,kindasapien,filcke,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/filcke/i_realised_definitely_just_a_bit_of_it_yesterday/,121,1584233401.0,"This happened yesterday morning. I use a bicycle to travel to work. So en-route as I reached one of the traffic lights, there was this guy on some 4-5 year old splender idling his bike on zebra crossing.

I stopped some 1/2 feet  before zebra crossing. Now we we were the only two guys on that side. Some 15 seconds later a girl on activa stops next to me before zebra crossings.

Now this guy starts revving up his engine and started looking back towards his silencer as if checking that there is something wrong with his bike. There was nothing wrong - no black or white smoke. He was just checking out the girl. Then this guy slowly started reversing his bike and placed it before the zebra crossing between me and that girl and kept revving his bike for other 20 sec till lights turned green. 

Whille he was reversing and revving I had a feeling that he was doing this as a show-off. The girl and I happened to look at each other and her expression seemed to say ""yes I know what he is doing"" as if reading my mind.

As the light turned green they happen to turn in different directions and that guy might have followed her if they were going the same way, I relaxed a bit but it creeped me out.

I will not try to be holier than thou. I also checkout girls and I am sure girls also checkout boys - which is normal. But I do that very discreetly and never have been the one indulging in catcalling or someone who stares till the girl disappears in the crowd or ""ghar tak chod kar ayenge"" types.

It is normal to checkout individuals from opposite gender but catcalling and staring to make other person uncomfortable is not.

We Indian men need to understand this.


Edit 1:

Seems like this post has divided opinions.

A) Some people are shouting out about this post being generalising for all Indian men.

I want to make it very clear -

I pointed out the issue and not singled out the person.

 when I used the term ""Indian men"" I was referring to those who indulge in such attention seeking gimmicks. And if you do not do that I didn't call you out.

And if you are not satisfied now, then come let's nitpick the skin from hair. 

B) There are others who are taking the side of the other guy and are pointing out that it may just have been an issue with his bike.

Which is a fair point. But is based on presumption.
And for that I would say two things:


        1) I develop engines and can tell you if something is wrong with the engine. I am very sure everything was fine with that bike.



        2) This happened in chandigarh and if you have a idea about Gedi culture here you will know what such signals are meant for. And I know what that meant

C) Lastly, those who understood this thanks for trying to reason with others

**EDIT 2:**

This is getting out of hand

**To all the NOT ALL MEN brigade**


Hear me out and answer this honestly to  yourself (do not post here if your ego hurts).
Whenever you go out with your girlfriend, sister or any female relative of yours don't you always have to look out for male leching?

If you do not then you are living in a really good place my friend. But if you do that ,then what you are assuming is that all men will want to look at them. You yourself think that sub-consciously that ""All men will do this"".

And yet men like you are here trying to sound cool by putting forward an irrational argument that is essentially disguised form of saying I didn't do this. What shall i do with that? where does that lead?",2020-03-15 06:20:01

The Narrative Structure of a WhatsApp Forward,317,Non-Political,electroutlaw,fnh884,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnh884/the_narrative_structure_of_a_whatsapp_forward/,52,1584985166.0,"With a global pandemic on full swing and lockdown on many cities of the nation, I, like most citizens, have locked myself behind the doors of my house.
With so much time on my hand, thanks to quarantine, I started reading numerous WhatsApp forwards to entertain myself. These messages contained a trove of erroneous information but were so hilarious I overlooked them. 


Soon, I started noticing similarities in these messages. So, I decided to find out what ingredients these messages use and are there any underlying structure for these messages.


After reading, analysing, and breaking down a lot of such messages, here’s what I found:


**These messages contain**:


1)	 Appeal to the reader’s pride in national and cultural heritage:    
> A very important reason these forwards work is the emotional appeal in them. The messages implore the readers by using words like ‘Countrywide efforts’, ‘mentioned in Puranas/Vedas’, ‘Proud to be an Indian’,  etc.


2) 	Claims supported by a prestigious scientific organisation, astrological events, or philosophical reasoning:    
> Your mentions of NASA, UNESCO, WHO, etc. come here. But these are not alone. Mentions of astrological events like Amavasya, Poornima, the position of planets and stars, etc. also find their way in such messages.    
> It is a very simple trick to make an unsuspecting reader trust the information in the message.


3)	 Use of first-person plural pronouns:    
> Plenty of these messages are written in first-person plural pronouns. It is an easy trick to allow the reader to connect with the emotions behind the message because of the first-person pronouns and plural ‘we’ or ‘us’ gives the reader a sense of belonging. The reader feels that they are not alone and are a part of a group.


4)	 The germinal idea:    
> The most important thing in the message is the ‘germinal idea’. It is the information the message has to spread. The idea is worded simply and can be summed up easily.


5)	 Lastly, emojis of the Indian Flag, Namaste, Aum, etc. also crop up in these messages from time to time.


**The narrative structure**:    


Now that I knew the ingredients these messages employ, I moved on to understand the way they appeared in the message. Was there a formula to structure the above-mentioned ingredients into a cohesive message? I decided to use the popular ‘Rule of 3’ to understand the structure.


The message is, usually, divided into three parts ‘The Hook’, ‘The Butter’, and ‘The Noose’.


**Part 1 - The Hook**:    
The reader may have a very small attention span, and so the message has to hook them early on. This is usually done with an interesting statement to communicate the germinal idea, but sometimes the names of scientific institutions like NASA, UNESCO, etc. can act as the hook too.    
Not everyone will read the complete text message and therefore the germinal idea has to appear as early as possible.


**Part 2 - The Butter**:    
Although, the reader is hooked and the germinal idea is communicated, but the chances that the reader is completely sold on the idea is very low.    
Therefore, The Butter provides the message with a credulity. This is done by mentioning the names of various institutions, person, equipment, or astrological events.    
This part of the message is worded to sound like facts but are usually false.


**Part 3 - The Noose**:    
The reader may have bought the facts mentioned in Part 2, but the message needs their blind faith. So, the message now ties a noose around the readers by appealing to their emotions.    
This can be done by using one's pride in nation, culture, history, or religion. This part plays a fairly important role because emotions are powerful enough override to logical decisions.


Sprinkle in a few emojis and the ‘Fake WhatsApp Forward™’ is now complete.",2020-03-23 23:09:26

Besides, our LPG cylinder is about to be empty and it has been over 8 days since I booked a refill but it hasn't arrived yet. When I call the Indane distributor, he says that all work is closed due to lockdown and they can't commit when I'll get the cylinder.

I live in South Delhi. Any property within 15km of my location starts at 3cr+

Even new apartments coming up in Gurgaon are 3-5cr

The house I currently live in is valued at over 2.4cr. I pay 42k as rent. 

Even after making 40L last year, these rates are just absurd to me. Yet, every new development coming up around me is 4-5cr minimum.

Who is buying all this property? And why is it there such a massive discrepancy between rent and sale value? In most cases, even with a generous downpayment, rent is 25-30% of monthly EMI.

I’m an American who was dating a guy from India. We’re both in our late 20s, he’s Catholic, from Kerala, and we had been dating for over a year.

He flew to India to visit his family last September. He said he wanted to go early in the year so that we could spend Christmas and New Years together. But instead he started ghosting me for a couple of weeks and when I wouldn’t stop texting him as I was worried, he finally replied with a long breakup text. He said his parents were retiring and so he was moving back to India forever to help his parents move, and said he had no choice but to break up with me and wants me to move on.

I recently found out from his Whatsapp photo that it wasn’t true at all…in reality he just got married, and he's still working in the states. I have not attempted to contact nor confront him since before he dumped me via text message -- his text was the last piece of communication between us.

I’ve read in passing that it’s not unheard of for NRI's to dump their foreign girlfriends right before they tie the knot with someone in their community, so easily like it’s some sort of past time. And then it becomes this deep dark secret they laugh about with their mates after work. Please tell me this isn't true? When I told our mutual Indian friend about this, he (the friend) was more in disbelief/shock by the fact that it happened to me rather than *what* had happened.

I’m torn between feeling devastated vs. feeling pure anger and hatred like I was just manipulated by a sociopath for over a year. We were each other’s best friend, we loved each other, made a bunch of other forever-promises that couples do… Or was he just practicing for his future wife...",2020-02-08 15:38:47

I ask because although I’m 30 years old and my high school years are a thousand years behind me, I’ve always believed that part of the reason I used to get picked on and bullied by my peers in my teens so much is because they noticed how much certain teachers would pick on me and since children are impressionable, they thought it was ok to do the same. I think teachers saw me as an 'easy target' and got some of rush out of bullying me.

Children follow by example. If adults bully, children will do the same.

There have been so many instances of teachers simply acting unprofessional and mentally unstable when there is no reason to. Don’t get me wrong; I’m all for discipline but beating students up like you are training for a Rambo movie, verbally abusing a student like you’re some kinda raging alcoholic trying to win a screaming contest in a bar fight (you get the picture), mentally harassing a student because your husband hits on your student’s family friend’s older daughter at a mutual social gathering (yeah, that actually happened with me)....are all unacceptable :-| :-| :-|

Has anyone else experienced situations like this when you were in high school too?

I don't know if it's allowed to post this here but I don't know what to do ....I'm scared shitless right now. 

Basically I'm having a crisis .... 

I'm having intrusive thoughts about well ... Scary things .....

It started with an obsession about being accused of something falsely based on my post history and search history . Though I'm not doing anything suspicious.... But I still had the fear due to me being from a poor family ... 

That escalated to ""maybe I am actually a criminal"" ... This seemed like an irrational thought but I started believing it out of fear and having additional thoughts like maybe I'm an insane criminal etc . And that this world is a hallucination and that in reality I'm a criminal... I'm still scared that this is a part of my updated fear  escalated to well ... That I'm going to hell and that my life would become miserable to the point of death ....

Now the fear is because of a dream I had a while ago about how my life would become really scary and that I'd be drifted apart by everyone and would be hated and that I would hurt them too . Or maybe that I was never loved and that I wouldn't be able to return to my loved ones

And that I'd lose everything basically .... Which really scared me a lot . And in those dreams was a mysterious figure who looked like Ryuk from the Anime Death note , mocking me . I was scared for some time but the fear subsided . Now I'm getting scared even more ... Because some details in that dream became true ... Like me contemplating suicide or drugs.... But I was scared that that wouldn't be an end to it . It seems similar to right now...... Which is really scary 

Especially the ""not returning to loved ones part"" 

Most of my friends are online and I'm in a long distance relationship ..... And because of those anxieties , I haven't contacted them ..... And I've been scared shitless ...... 

Many of the other things I'm noticing are ""signs"" like typos , writings , ads and specefic coincidental wordings and events occuring that I take as ""warnings"" ......  And some bad things happening with me lately .... Even my mom is acting weird ... This all seems determinential ..... It's so scary .... Thinking of an eternal being waiting to torture you for eternity ......

I even saw 2 anime that matched the dream like Babylon and Hell girl ....... 

Because of which I'm unable to let my guard down ....

And it's really scaring me ......

Even if most relegions might not have hell ... I'm scared of there being a different hell .... From relegions ... That is eternal .... It's really scary and ruining my health

I'm scared of this possibility and don't know what to do ....",2020-04-10 06:10:24

Lot of things going down these days, but I happened to read a book which uplifted me a little bit, and that I used to write to about India - Factfulness. I am sure a lot of you must have heard about/read this book. The books talks about how the world is becoming a better place, but we may not be seeing it. True, there is still a lot of bad things happening, but the big picture is gradually getting better.

In the context of India, there are a few parameters I considered that show the growth of the society - 

1. Population - Contrary to the popular belief, our population growth has in fact slowed down to almost half it growth rate from previous years.
2. Fertility Rate - Our average fertility rate is lower than the world average! We started from \~6 children per woman after independence and have gone down to \~2.1. The world average is 2.4.
3. Life expectancy - Our life expectancy is improving at a rate almost 2x the world average.
4. Secondary school enrolment for girls - Compared to the world average growth of 1.7%, India's rate of enrolment has been increasing at \~3.5x of that for the last 20 years!

I'm just fed up with people telling me that men don't cry. I'm fed up with the fact that when someone fights me, people expect me to fight back, because that's 'manly'.

Why does society expect too much from me because I am a man? When I pick up a book to read in school, people mock me for being a 'nerd' and 'girly'. What's wrong with being 'girly'? I mean, imagine a family where the father remains at home caring for children while the mother goes to work. You can expect people to mock the man for not being 'manly'. Why is there too much pressure on a man to be 'manly'? Why do I feel like the entire society is here to judge me as a man? Are men nothing but labour machines without emotions — one whose sole purpose in life is to work to sustain his family financially, one whose honour and image as a man comes above everything else, including his own happiness? Don't we feel sadness? Don't we feel stress? Don't we need someone to support us emotionally? Someone to offer us a shoulder to cry on? I was just too afraid to cry in front of others, too scared to share my woes with others, too scared to show a weakness. But not any more.

1. Age old manuscript/knowledge and books:

So, we are passed on from Generations the books like Gita, Bible, and Quran and many others. And people telling it from so long. The story of Ram and Krishna passed on through ages. It’s true or not, it does not matter. It was so beautifully written and embedded that even its not true. It’s worth considering. And no one can prove it wrong anyhow, why? that we will discuss in the third point.

2. Exceptional bliss, fortune or lottery:

So, there are times people experience, so-called God bliss. By that, I mean a person facing a lot of issues in life may be due to a different person or someone. And after some time, like a lottery everything becomes fine, everything is so great around.

I think this happens with most of the people around. And that is how I think life is a game of probability that is not evenly distributed or maybe it is even. It’s like someone is so happy, someone is so rich, someone life is getting turned at this very moment, someone is poor, someone is going to die after a second of birth.

Its all a game of probability, opportunities are probable, sometimes it is such that you hit a six at times when you are at the worst part of life, and you believe there is an external force acting and yes, it is. It is the force of probability.

And yeah, you may think it doesn’t happen with everyone, its probability, It happens with some people, so why everyone still believes in God. It’s because, if it happens to one, and the one is watched by many. So, everyone thinks, ya there is some force and there is some God. Maybe there is…

3. You cannot prove something, that doesn’t exist:

So, a great philosopher. I don’t remember exactly who, once said if anyone asks you, do god exists or not. You can say yes, it exists. Why?

Because if God exists, you are right. And if he doesn’t exist, then you can never prove something that doesn’t exist. Like if I say, I am seeing a God, a unicorn or something in this room, and even if it exists or not. You will say it does not. But in this infinite, exponentially expanding universe, that you cannot see, how will you prove that a thing/force does not exist. You cannot prove negativity. You cannot prove things that don’t exist. You can only prove things that exist.",2020-04-10 05:30:28

I came out to my parents two years ago. I repent that I didn’t do it any sooner. That’s a different story related to internalised homophobia and bearing extreme shame inside. I used to constantly contemplate taking myself off this earth (not that I still don’t think about it)

My parents are hoping that I might come around and say yes to the Indian societal acceptance of marriage. I am honestly exhausted putting up with my mum. We argue sometimes but more than that I feel MASSIVE guilt. Have I taken their happiness from them? Have I caused shame to my family for what I am? What if people start asking questions when my brother is getting married and me being the elder one is still unmarried? Should I just give up on life where I could be myself and just submit to them and spend my life in a loveless and sexless marriage?

All these questions have been haunting me for the last ten years! I never had any friend that I could trust to tell them that I have been considering suicide for the past year or so, that I have been exhausted of living with myself and the world around me that doesn’t help. I have all of these thoughts inside that are eating me up alive and I feel that hell is inside me.

I feel so alone and dejected in life. All I have ever done in these twenty years is to suck it up all in and never show my vulnerability. All my life I adapted to not feel anything and do everything like I have been told. I get high everyday to drown the sorrow that nobody loves me. I have never had a boyfriend or felt the butterflies! 

Honestly I thought I could move out of the country but that option is looking bleak. I don’t have enough money saved for the move and the depression is getting stronger that I am losing the will to do anything to achieve my dream. There is inherently something wrong with me and I can’t put my finger on it. Travelling is all I wanted to do. But all I can think of is how fucking ugly I am with absolutely no skills to boast for. Like being a useless log that lies in bed all day. 

If this is all there is I would rather pull the trigger soon after I make enough money to support my parents after I am gone. I have nothing to look forward to, life’s a drag and I don’t want to continue the chain of bringing more lives into this ruthless world.

Sorry for the long rant. I don’t have enough avenues to vent out. I am so sorry, existence is a searing pain. I want to get done. I feel fucking awful.",2020-04-07 11:45:30

My experiment with using bumble in India.,5,Non-Political,throwawawy1999,g05iuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g05iuj/my_experiment_with_using_bumble_in_india/,32,1586756817.0,"So guys this is gonna be a bit long.                                                               
So basically I was super bored with the quarantine and I was talking to my girlfriend about random stuff. So something about online dating came up. I made a bumble profile with 3 decent pictures , a good bio ,also verified account. Guess how many matches I got ( 2 in an hour and 4 likes lol) . Bear in mind both my girlfriend and I are about a solid 9 facially  (she's a bit better maybe) but my body is  a bit above average (good frame)with slight muscle but nothing too great, but I'm on the shorter side about  5'7(I'm in South Delhi) But I certainly expected waay better results based on real life experience, I really didn't know how bad the competition is.  I wanted to see how demographics are skewed so I asked my girlfriend to send  3 random selfies  for experimenting , also none of these were taken with a proper camera(just front camera selfies) without the best lighting. Also I had no bio besides a question and my profile was unverified.  I swiped to mostly hot guys 8+, and had a 90% match rate( ridiculous). All these guys looked like models  were tall , had bodies I'd assume from more than a year of solid gymming , had great photos taken by probably a professional camera and great bio and in general had a lot of effort put on their profile all to match with a low effort unverified profile.I got 350+ likes and 100+ matches in about an hour ,hour and a half I was basically bamboozled with disparity of likes even though both of us are similarly attractive. I understand the complaints of a lot of Indian guys on bumble etc about not getting matches, but the fault is on guys and especially Indian guys y'all way too thirsty and have no or extremely low standards( bumble doesn't have a lot of white guys, almost none) the pedestalising of girls is insane. You're basically competing with Indian version of ""Chad"" if you call that if you do use online dating. The average Indian guy isn't attractive but online  there's a shit ton of ""hot"" guys in North India and most are on tinder/bumble so you'd probably get close to no matches, let alone decent ones and thats even if you're above average and have put a lot of effort in your profile. A girl in India on online dating is basically God mode. So anyone here even if you're hot guy  ( You'll probably lose your value since hot guys are dime a dozen here and fucks up the standards of all girls in general.), if you want to go for online dating.   Don't.  
1. It basically spoils the notion of love in an insane way. Basically makes it a number game which is Frankly ridiculous to me. Someone with 100+ hot guys in their profile won't be able to emotionally attach ,let alone choose between who they want. It's one of the reason is never wanted to date online even after way too many of my friends told me to. It's near impossible to find love where there isn't real time energy or connection involved.  

2. It raises the standards of even somewhat decent girls to an unattainable level for most guys who meet her and even hot guys , since all they have to do to find a hot guy is install and app an swipe. Men are probably as expendable as ever. In real life attractive people you actually come across and interact with and get along with is rare and that what makes is special(chance for a spark).  Online dating basically just gives you a plethora of these attractive people sitting at home  reducing the chances of someone being special to you way less and having a moment of actual chance encounters.(I met my girlfriend in a library, Sorry I'm a hopeless romantic)

"Why do so many Indians like to believe their parents are progressive and liberal, when they’re not?",96,Non-Political,I_can_believe_that,fo0b28,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fo0b28/why_do_so_many_indians_like_to_believe_their/,39,1585059943.0,"I’ve seen quite a lot of cultural rants on the internet and (unlike here) most comments tend to defend their parents and justify how progressive and liberal their parents are, it’s like they take offence whenever they see someone calling Indian parents conservative, backward and narcissists. 

I know a few parents are quite liberal and open minded, but they’re mostly limited to affluent families in metropolitan cities. But, the same can’t be said for most Indian families.

I always have a feeling that Indians suffer from Stockholm syndrome since childhood, they’re mentally exhausted by constant nagging or sometimes abuses by their parents and choose to submit/surrender and confuse obedience with love. Many Indian girls also like to believe their parents are open-minded and progressive just because they’re ‘allowed’ to go to a co-Ed school/college, until they start dating then all hell breaks loose.",2020-03-24 19:55:43

An interesting observation,140,Non-Political,futuoerectus,fhzqe6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fhzqe6/an_interesting_observation/,50,1584135321.0,"I frequent a tiny tea stall next to my workplace, and the seller is a Muslim (because he wears a skullcap).

Everyday, he would give me chai in one of those earthen clay pots. Today, he asked me whether it will be okay if he offers me in a paper cup because the earthen ones are out of stock. I saw some people having tea in glass tumblers, and asked him why does he not give me in one of those?

His reply was: **""Some people don't like eating in our utensils""**. I was shocked! 

The fuck, man! I had no idea earthen pots were used for such a purpose. I thought they enhanced the taste of chai!

Edit: To everyone who thinks I am bringing up a communal angle; here are a few things. First off, I do understand the point of view of hygiene, and why people would want paper cups / earthen pots; and that is a valid reason. Personally, I prefer the clay pots or glass tumblers over paper cups because the paper is flimsy and it burns my fingers.

My shock was at the statement the chaiwalla made: to paraphrase it in vernacular, ""Oneke amader basone khete chay na"", which translates to: ""A lot of people don't want to eat / drink from our utensils"".

This is new to me in a state like West Bengal where people rarely give a shit about caste / religion, especially when it comes to food (we love our biryanis).

It could be because of hygiene (which I will ask on Monday); or it could be because he has faced discrimination. To me, the statement pointed to the latter.",2020-03-14 03:05:21

And how can we forget the tuition classes \ computer class adverts & pamphlets & brochures which have the whole high school stereotype clique posing with bags & large books - one girl in glasses, a white guy in a green tee shirt, the athletic looking jock who's almost always African, an adorable Asian girl in a chic jacket - among others.

It took years before even our airports started featuring explicitly Indian models (but in OTT traditional, regional outfits) for general directions & imagery. And banks too.

Dark skinned Indians, East Indians are never even ***considered*** for representation - let alone headline these ad campaigns.

We(M22|F25) are in relationship from past three year.
We both have already planned for marriage after being in relationship for 1 year .



We also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.



Things are going not as I supposed to go .


Now she have changed her mind completely.


A brief background about her - She have a poverty based childhood and she have worked part time throughout her life to afford her family needs and her father was nothing less than a person just existing,never supported her and her mother.


Even now she and her mother supports the family.


No one respects her family as they are poor.


She feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering Indian society mentality.



Now she refuse to Marry me saying she would marry someone richer as I am also not in very good financial condition though I have a job in computer science field and I need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.


She wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in Indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.
She wants to rest and enjoy her life.


She said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.


She can decide whom to marry or not and I can't put pressure on her to marry me.


She also told me that she don't want to be part of me when I am struggling.


She will marry me only if I get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both EMI and lifestyle)


If she decides to marry me she have to work maybe for one year which she clearly said no that she don't want to marry me as if things don't workout the way we think then she will end up cursing me for snatching her opportunity of marrying someone richer.

I asked her that I will try my best to give her best life but I need one year of support from her so that I can buy a house on EMI but she ends up breaking up.

Now that hospital's lab person is saying I need to wait till end of the second phase of lockdown. The particular tests(HBV DNA QUANT and SAFP) are cheaper in this hospital due to tie up with NGO. If I get these done in other hospital, I need to spend three to four times more money. With no job currently and already bad financial condition, it's really a nightmare for me. I called government hospitals also but they are not doing any test due to COVID. It's not safe to take her to crowded hospital as she has diabetes also. Please tell me what should I do in this situation. The doctor told us to get the test urgently as situation is too critical.

- what exactly are you doing with PM cares fund? What is the progress?
- what is your plan to provide sufficient PPE kits to medical staff and doctors? By when? 
- what is India's plan to develop cure for covid-19 and by when can we see any outcome?
- what's up with economy and how you plan to fix it as covid-19 is controlled?
- what is the update on scaling up testing of COVID-19 cases?
- China built hospitals within days. Have you done anything like that or alternative to quarantine people?

I know PM wouldn't have exact answers to above questions. It's tough time. But he can atleast provide an update on these more critical questions in his video, rather than just praising public and asking them to do stupid things. Honestly, even I could do that. 

Secondly, this PM has no guts to hold press conference. Even trump is answering to reporters. Then why PM Modi can't? Why he choose to hide and talk from behind the screen only?

To my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask, I was stopped by a cop in civillian clothing and was asked what I was doing outside, to which I stated my reason and then was asked why I was not wearing a mask and told him the truth. I was then struck by the cop with a swat bat thingy thrice at that point, I decided to floor my bike and dipped out of there at fool speed. 

I can't help but rationlize why I was struck. My friend says that I was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. He then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (My friend btw, is Indian and lives in a Middle Eastern country). Was it right for the cop to strike me? I can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe I should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened. What do you guys think?

Edit: Thank you guys for clearing up my views on the situation of what I had gone through. I didn't mention this but, I am sort of new to India, I came here like last year to complete my UG, so I didn't take into account that the Indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where I was raised (i.e, Middle East). I admit that I was in the wrong for not wearing a mask, however, I don't think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering I showed him proof of reason as to why I was outside in the first place. 

Neither do I think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as I think he would've conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first. As far as I've heard, the cops in this country are far from the best but I shouldn't judge them individually based on what I may have heard but I cannot deny what I've heard or read anyway.",2020-04-14 17:22:41

"Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?",9,AskIndia,curiouspupil,fx71yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx71yh/are_peopleespecially_men_really_okay_with_with/,104,1586383578.0,"Note: I am not saying this should apply to only women. same applies to men too (you can reverse the genders in below). it is not right that women need not worry about their husbands past(they can and should)

A little background: I am a bit on the introverted spectrum, I live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

I still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**My questions are -**

1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?
4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

Please dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

And sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200B;

PS:

By intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

And I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)

Its not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn't. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)

And no judgement at all, I practice live and let live(if it sounded so, I didnt mean it, i am happy to correct it). I just wanted to understand what the reality/truth is.",2020-04-09 03:36:18

How do I get my boyfriend's parents to give me a chance?,43,AskIndia,throwaway9055555,fvgj13,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvgj13/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriends_parents_to_give_me_a/,51,1586132930.0,"I hate being a white girl barging in during a global pandemic to talk about my own shit but if anyone wants to get their mind off of it with some sweet in-law drama, read on.

So we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

Switch to me. I'm very in love with him. We've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

Switch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I'm not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""I'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

What we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

I don't expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don't want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They're just gonna tell me I'm useless for however many minutes. 

Idk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.

We have a great understanding between us and we have opened up and talked about our lives before one another. I have grown up in a relatively conservative family. Although my parents were never against meeting girls (or dating one), I just could not devote any time towards it during undergraduate due to the heavy workload of an engineering degree. So this was my first real relationship and I am very happy with my partner (same age as me).

However, her undergrad life was very different, which included lots of drinking, partying, dating, sex, and several hookups. Today, she is very focussed on her career, makes healthier lifestyle choices (no more substances and drinking), and is making conscious efforts to make a life for herself that she can be proud of (she isn't proud of anything she's done in the past and has broken all ties with people from that time). To be clear, I myself have never indulged in alcohol, substances, partying, or hookups.

We both get along really well, and I have been trying to be very open-minded about her past (given that it is very much on the opposite side of the spectrum to mine). I don't want to sound regressive because I understand this happens, but I am unsure how to cope with the feelings of discomfort and off-putting mental images that come up in my mind.

[P] How to deal with parents who support extreme government authoritarianism?,65,AskIndia,impstuff,fwo8b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwo8b6/p_how_to_deal_with_parents_who_support_extreme/,28,1586308032.0,"My dad seems to be going down this path of extreme authoritarianism. He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

How do I explain this to him? I'm considering never discussing politics with him for I adore and respect my dad and I'd hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things. FML.",2020-04-08 06:37:12

And honestly, the lockdown is scaring me really bad. The prices of food items like potatoes, tomatoes, etc have risen significantly, or the supplies are almost finished. Many shops which sell basic groceries are closed and their owners say they are afraid if they will be arrested by the police even though groceries have been exempted. Even though I am from a middle class family, I know many low income families who are more paranoid about this situation. If people don't get to eat, they will die from hunger anyways.

I don't know about Economics, but is there a possibility that people might die more because of the lockdown rather than coronavirus? Many vegetables are absolutely finished in our local markets, and given that most vegetables, meat, etc come through local trains which are now non-operational, how will we get basic stuff like food? From what I know, poor people still have ration card to meet their requirements, and rich people, well, have their money to get through the system. What about most of us? 

Another thing is jobs. Due to these shutdowns, the businesses will face huge losses, jobs like hawkers, small shops, cottage industries, chaiwala, panwala, panipuriwala, etc will mostly go without any money. And if this lockdown is extended, which it most probably will, won't several million people just die due to lack of money and food?

Edit: I sometimes go on Libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because Covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people.

Do you think India should revoke lockdown on April 14 ?,62,AskIndia,Smooth_Guidance,fwm5c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwm5c3/do_you_think_india_should_revoke_lockdown_on/,33,1586301023.0,"Personally, I believe that our corona virus cases would increase exponentially after April 14 if lockdown is revoked.

* India’s current total infected cases is 4,900 and we are testing about 12,000 people per day. Which I think is nowhere near enough. 

* United States had around 5000 cases before March 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on March 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.

Even if we’re on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the Nizamuddin Dargah, hundreds of people celebrating Ram Navmi despite lockdown, Dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on April 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it’s Diwali... So, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they’d mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it’d started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. 

Also if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we’ll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve. May sources also claimed India will peak the epidemic around April first week, which is far from truth. But according to speculations from artificial intelligence, India will peak during June-July..",2020-04-08 04:40:23
Why are we Indians bad at taking risks?,10,AskIndia,nota_grammar_nazi,fzr4n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzr4n4/why_are_we_indians_bad_at_taking_risks/,49,1586699495.0,"When we compare ourselves to people in the west, I think we can say that we are just as talented as them if not more and we have a bigger population which means the number of intelligent Indians is more even if the percentage of intelligent Indians is not higher. 

But why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a start-up or taking jobs with high risk? I am not saying that working at a 9-5 job is bad, but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers, right?

In my opinion the reason why Americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt. We should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents. 

Please note that I am not judging anyone who works at a no risk job. I was just wondering why as a country we all do this. I also understand that the risk taking culture has improved in the past few years.

But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day. 

As I said, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment and probably we won't get any. But I am trying with all my luck if some miraculous solution emerge. If it helps, he was already screened for Covid at Delhi airport and was tested negative. Also, he has been mostly living alone for the past few weeks and do not have any symptoms.

Women in India with 31 fingers called a witch throughout her life.,578,AskIndia,raghav48,fjj42g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjj42g/women_in_india_with_31_fingers_called_a_witch/,36,1584384916.0,"Life becomes unbearable without the love and affection of the family members and the belongingness of society. Unfortunately for KumariNayak, a 63-year-old woman from the Ganjan district of Odisha, her life has been a humiliation because she has Polydactylism.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/se8pqngcm0n41.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a05d1d9821b72ee428b88ec5d46e8bd0b2a717b

Polydactylism is a defect in the body where the person suffers from abnormal growth. In the case of Kumari, she was born with 19 toes and 12 fingers by birth. Her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names. 

Kumari said in an interview: ‘I was born with this defect and I couldn’t be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. ‘

As she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. She feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can’t fight a long battle with superstitions. Therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.

It has now been 63 years that I have had this condition. She said in the interview, ‘The residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that I am a witch and keep away from me. They sometimes come to see my condition – but never help. ‘I am forced to stay indoors as I am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.’

One of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of Kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. And, Kumari’s medical condition has made her the witch of the village.

On hearing Kumari’s situation, government officials of India have decided to come to her aid. She is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. Even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.

In 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. Even though the government of India is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases. 

Let's hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.

I see someone's profile on social media (but no conversation there), by chance meet them IRL and have a conversation with them only to realize they are not the same person as they portray themselves on social media. They are not same intellectually, personality wise, thoughts, looks etc.

I'm not talking about dating or something but talking to someone in general, be it a guy or a girl. Also am not judging anyone, just saying how could someone be so different than what they are on social media and what they actually are. I mean little bit here and there on social media is fine but portraying  yourself as a completely different person is just desperation to seek attention.

I am an American woman (26), dating a South Indian born man (32). Even though we come from contrasting backgrounds, we share the same religious beliefs (we're both Hindu), morals, and attitudes. Recently, he told me that he loves me and wants to marry me, but there is one problem: his parents. 

His parents want to arrange a marriage for him. I'm not against this practice, but I happen to love this man, and I couldn't imagine a life without him (I know, very cliche). 

I understand that since I am not an Indian woman (I'm  African-American and white), was raised Muslim (I practice Hinduism now), and that I am also the offspring of divorced and twice-married parents, that there is no way in hell my boyfriend's parents are going to approve of our marriage. 
My boyfriend is asking me to stay hopeful and travel to India with him this year so that his parents can meet me. During that time, he plans to ask his parents for their approval. 
I have been in two previous relationships where my ex-boyfriend's parents disapproved of me because I was black...and those relationships simply ended because they chose their parents over me.

Hi reddit.

For context, I am 20F and my cousin is 28M now. I was 15/16 when this happened and he was 24. I live in the states, but my family is really indian (culturally) so I thought I would get the best opinion here. 

I've made a post about my sexual abuse story: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dlq0s1/was_i_molested_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_if_i_am/). I would suggest at least skimming over it but it is not necessary. Long story short, when I was 16, my cousin snuck in the room several times at times and touched me inappropriately (boobs (fondling and pinching my nipples) and my hip (I think he tried to touch my ""area"" but  I started getting more aggressive and he stopped, but he might have when I was sleeping). For those of you asking why I didn't stop him after the first time, I was scared of not being believed but I did tell him to stop several times and he wouldn't. Anyway. Recently I have been doing a lot of emotionally processing and healing, and this trauma is at the root of most of my mental health issues. I was extremely angry and resentful towards him for 4 years (rightfully so) but it took a huge toll on my mental health and didn't allow me to heal from this. I'm conflicted because he is not a ""bad"" person. Yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult. Our family is very close so I've been around him A LOT these past few years, and we've had a lot of great moments together and I *almost* forgot what happened for a split second every time. I want to forgive him, especially for myself, but I don't know how to do that. Personally, I know that I need to have a conversation with him about this but I don't know how to bring this up. I don't even know if he remembers or if he will admit to it, but I think I'm prepared for both of those outcomes. My question is, is he worthy of forgiveness? I know it's a healing process for me, but does he deserve to know that I have forgiven him? Also, how would you go about this situation? Any and all advice is appreciated!

Funds are getting tapered by every passing day, although I'm thankful to this kind hearted soul who don't wish to be named for helping me out with some money last time. I also don't want to stuck in Delhi with everything closed and the risk of getting infected getting higher with having no money to even afford a ticket back to home.

Although rape is a serious problem in our country that needs to stop. There is another problem of false rape accusations that nobody seems to wanna talk about.,59,AskIndia,Rking_9516,fleoe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fleoe8/although_rape_is_a_serious_problem_in_our_country/,53,1584670211.0,"Before I start, I'd like to make it clear that I do believe Rape is a heinous crime and there should be severe punishments for those who commit it. Having said that, shouldn't someone who is innocent also getting the same punishment and being discarded by society be talked about too? what about the woman who made up the story, shouldn't she be punished for ruining someone's life? 

According to the National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 38,947 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. In 10,068 cases – about a quarter – the women claimed it was rape on the false promise of marriage. In Andhra Pradesh state, 45% of all rape cases filed in the past two years fell into the false marriage category. Just think about that, every 1 in 3 is an innocent man, and in Andra Pradesh, that's 1 in 2 where for every 2 rape accusations an innocent man's life is ruined.

It's sad because Rape is a very sensitive subject which people avoid talking about and these problems are still happening every day. I'm tired of hearing every other country saying that our country is the rape capital of the world and no one if only a few dares to talk about false accusations.

So what are some of these quirky beliefs that your family has been following these days to be protected from the coronavirus?

For example, in my family whenever we get anything from outside, like vegetables, fruits, groceries (in sealed packets), we wash them outside our house bringing them in. First we wash them with a solution of water and baking soda/salt and then keep them to dry in the sun for an hour or two. And then the person who went out to get the stuff(which is mostly me) has to immediately take a bath and wash the clothes as well.

[Here is todays stuff in the sun after being thoroughly washed.](https://imgur.com/a/mhoGdgZ)

A little bit about me ever since I was 9yrs old I have been a fan of animation ( anime in particular ) and through various trials in my life from not been able to draw a simple circle to convince my parents to let me choose animation as my career path I have come a long way (I mean for me atleast) 

I don't know how to explain this feeling but for the past couple of days (7-10maybe) I have been very down , depressed , my heart aches daily like there's a hand grabbing my heart pressing it what not and I have even cried a lot before going to sleep ( silently although I wanted to shout at the top of my head but couldn't as it would wake my parents ) 

What I am trying to say maybe is that I am currently feeling as if I don't know anything about animation be it 2d or 3d ..everyday I keep on practicing and learning and try to do my best but it never feels enough and I am worried sick what will I do after I graduate ( I am in my 2nd year if college ) 

The thing is I am self taught because I failed my NID and DUFA exam mainly because I have been practicing art digitally since I was in 9-10th standard or so and the exams where in traditional medium my dad asked if I wanted to go for a private uni for arts but I declined the offer because I was told by a couple of people and professional that it's pretty much useless and I chose one of the easiest course in DU in the hopes that I will have a lot of free time to teach myself and spare money to buy equipment if necessary (my fee is only 27000 for 3years)  both of these things came true I do have a a lot of time and my fee is not much .

I knew this was a risky move getting into a course that's not related to animation ( it is, if u thing of it as a business because I do want to have my own studio and it does kinda help ) and I believed a lot in myself that I will do good but apparently I haven't ! As much as I want to tell my parents that I am scared as to what I would do in the future, I just can't because it won't help me and would only stress them because they will start worrying and it's not like they know anything about animation and would start making calls for knowledge and help ..I don't want to give them that kind of a stress right now .

I should also mention this I do plan to do a 6 month diploma on animation and fine arts after I graduate respectively 

The reason I made this post is because I wanted to let go of this feeling JUST LET ME OUT. And get a good couple of advice from people who are in the Animation industry as to how it works and stuff and get in touch with them , get some advice from people to resolve this feeling and most importantly to find myself a mentor who couple give me tasks to do this and that either weekly or monthly and later review my works and broadly point my mistakes and give me some direction 

All the hard-work would come from me but I need someone to guide me ! YouTube videos would never point out my mistake and I need someone to I guess

I will link my best works at the end.

I have figured I work best when someone gives me deadline to work with. I just need someone to tell me who actually has knowledge to from either school or industry to give me assignment and nothing more I will find what that things means etc etc and just review my work at the end .

I beg you if you thing you have that kind of knowledge and can spare 30-40min a week or a month please help this stranger ( I told my name in the beginning because I believe one stops thing of you as a complete stranger if they know your name ) 

You don't even have to give me your phone number or email address we can talk directly on Reddit message or Instagram or Facebook or any other app that you might thing is comfortable ( in case this message looks like a scam) 

But I beg you if you can spare a couple of minutes a week or a month to help me please do although I don't have anything to give in return but I would be ever grateful for your help.

PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU CAN.

I have been a member of this community for so long and I love this community for its progressive thoughts. I wanted to get something off my chest and also ask you folks' opinion.

I have held this off inside me for too long but today want to put it out. My father is a narcissist and manipulative person. He hasn't worked in his entire life and has only done few menial jobs for very less time. My mother has struggled hard to raise me by securing a government job with her father's and brother's efforts.

However, father has been abusive and manipulative to her and she has put up with it because of Indian society, chaar log kya kahenge bla bla. I hadn't recognised this before or tried to ignore it thinking it will be ok later and also I stay away from them since I work in a faraway city and visit them once in a while.  This time due to corona effect I had to travel since I stay alone and can't cook for shit.

Today morning again he started with his bullshit about some silly reason to her and I couldn't hold any longer and got into an argument with him to defend her. The shouting match prevailed and neighbour could hear us. After this, I realized that this is not good so I sat and tried to reason with him for almost three hours and also apologised for shouting at him. But he got only defensive and never discussed his actual feeling out but instead started blaming me and my mother about everything. It's strange that he doesn't even recognize that it is her and to some extent my hard work that is putting the food on the table.

Why is accent such a big thing in India?,13,AskIndia,lonelyscoopofbutter,fzylo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzylo0/why_is_accent_such_a_big_thing_in_india/,14,1586733882.0,"Hi, I always wondered about why people (not everyone) care so much about English and Accents? 

We are taught how to read, speak and write English in school at a very young age, the whole purpose of doing that is to makes us comfortable and confident in English. English is very important in Indian education system as it's the only subject which is common all across India. Even in universites they have a separate ""Professional Communication"" course where the sole purpose of the whole course is to learn how to speak like a native speaker. And even if it is not , but still, isn't the main goal of learning a language is to speak like the natives? Like German, Korean, etc? I don't know why people judge everyone because of their accent? If you have a very good accent and speak your ""Ts and Ds"" like a native speaker then you are deemed as fake and stupid and this is only limited for English! I have never seen anyone make fun of someone who was speaking, say German or Mandarin or even French, it's only specific to English. I know how Indians born and raised outside of India are treated here, people make fun of their accent or look at them funny lol. 

On the other hand, if someone doesn't have a very good accent or has a very strong Mother Tongue Influence they are treated the same way, I'm sure you have seen a ton of videos on Facebook or Instagram where people are laughed at only because they have a very bad accent or are probably trying to learn a new language. 

I don't know why people do this? I have never seen it anywhere else, everyone has a different accent and that's how it works, you can't expect 1.3B people to have a same accent all across the country. A classic example is Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone, both are international celebrities former has an Indian-American accent while latter has an Indian Accent still I see people call then ""Fake"" and ""Cringey"" lol, why? 
Why is English a set parameter for confidence and knowledge? People in South Korea, France, Norway or Germany don't speak in English and if they do they have an accent but no one cares about it but here in India it's really complicated, you should have a accent but it shouldn't be like a native speaker but you will be shamed if you have a very strong accent as it's"" funny"", if you speak in ""English"" you are confident and more intelligent than someone who necessarily isn't good at speaking English. 

Any thoughts on this?

Tldr: Learning a new language comes with an accent, it's either good (like a native speaker) or influenced by your mother tongue. It's usually fine around the world but in India is usually frowned upon, if you don't have an ""Indian Accent"": you are fake and ""angrez"" and if you have a very strong Indian accent: you are funny, not confident enough, which gives everyone a right to judge your ""knowledge"" or ""intelligence"". There's no middle ground. This is only limited to English and not to any other languages (German, French, etc.)",2020-04-13 04:54:42

But I'm fed up with life here. My current company does send its employees abroad - US, Germany etc. but they are senior developers or team leads. I want to move out asap. Is there any company in India that does send its junior developers onsite ? Or is there any other way to apply abroad directly ?

I've had a great childhood, my parents have been very liberal about most things except the fact that I get married outside the community. That's all they've ever asked. As luck would have it, recently told my mother about my north-Indian boyfriend and she is shocked. Told me they will never accept this, especially my father, who she said might commit suicide. She hasn't even asked me questions about my boyfriend,  just says ""we don't accept this, you can do what you want"". She is not one for emotional reactions or drama (which I would honestly prefer at this point), just says ""No, not happening."" That's it, and she is supposed to be the more reasonable one. I managed to wheedle some information  that might matter to them in while talking, including how much he makes (""Don't run after money, not important!!"") and that his family is on-board (""then do what you want, we don't accept it, it will never happen!!""

Telling my father is going to be a whole other event. He cares even more deeply about the caste, can be counted on to always have an emotional reaction than a reasonable one. Logic almost always eludes him. I'm actually worried about his blood pressure when I break this to him. The hypocrisy is strong because I found out about his affair, but that has conveniently been forgotten. I don't want to use that as ammo but might have to if it gets out of hand.Also, my relatives are pieces of shit. My brother lives in the US and had a inter-caste marriage himself, but they use that for ""he has done this to us already, you can't do this as well. We'll become the laughing stock of the family"" My brother has done his bit by trying to talk to Mom and is supportive, but that's doesn't seem to be helping.

I'm successful, make decent money, am financially independent and am living in a separate apartment even with my parents in the same city because it's closer to work. My boyfriend is extremely smart and successful, makes more money than my parents can fathom and is genuinely, obviously the nicest guy. I'm convinced if they meet him, they will find no reason to fight this, but I'm sure they will refuse to meet him for a very long time.

My parents and I don't usually fight, unless we're discussing politics. The fact that my mother is being cold and the fear of telling my father is honestly too much to take and beginning to cause a strain on my interactions even with my boyfriend, who is doing everything he can to be present.

Otherwise it will essentially be lying / withholding information.

Most of my friends married without revealing their struggles. I am talking about both male and female friends, from big cities and towns as well.

Obviously I don't know where they will be five or ten years from now. But as of now things seem to be going well.

Obviously I don't really know what exactly is going on in their personal lives.

The mental struggles do manifest although, and could be kept hidden for only so long.

I believe that some illnesses although are more severe than others, especially those illnesses that require antipsychotic medicines. As they can cause sexual dysfunction - erectile dysfunction.

So this could severely impact the quality of sex life of the couple. 

Other than that the mental struggles tend to be genetic. So the offspring is likely to have some positive or negative abnormalities. But it could be really positive too, as relatives of people with mental health issues can often be high achievers as well.

I myself have lived a life of honesty, so I never hide. Although people are quick to assume about the severity of the illness. And they being to imagine dramatic images of people who struggle with these illness.

So, it tends to become a conflict of interest.

So some people decide to keep things to themselves, because others might exaggerate for fun. And it might lead to them being Ostracized. 

I personally am not a big fan of marriage or seeking companionship etc although I want to conform with the social norms to some degree. And there always is interest of family members as well.

Is UPI becoming unreliable?,77,AskIndia,skynil,fd7v8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fd7v8a/is_upi_becoming_unreliable/,63,1583326106.0,"I've always held UPI as one of the most impactful technology that had been implemented in India over the last few years. The simplified payment system has made transactions simpler and much easier to execute and track, and me along with most of my friends, colleagues and even my parents have started using it for day to day transactions.

But recently, the entire platform is behaving very erratically. And while the problems used to happen to banks earlier, now it's effecting individual apps as well. Below are a few observations from the last few months:


1. More often than not, UPI transactions are failing to complete. Sometimes the money is getting debited, and then the status stays pending. Other times, the money isn't debited. But in both cases, the payment is not being made. And as a user, I've no visibility where my money is.


2. At times the beneficiary isn't getting the money or the sms immediately, and although the payment is a success at my end, the beneficiary is refusing to accept the payment because he can't track.


3. Individual apps are becoming unreliable, especially Google pay. The transactions take much longer to complete than other apps (paytm is faster, and Samsung pay upi for some reason is the fastest). It's a bit difficult to point the finger towards the app (Google pay) because scaling shouldn't be a problem with them. 


4. Inconsistent failures are also happening. When Google pay is saying bank server not available, paytm got the transaction through. Which didn't happen earlier as my own bank server going down affected all apps equally. Now a days, it's difficult to predict where or how the failure is taking place.


Overall, the platform is slowly becoming very very unreliable for larger transactions. There's no accountability, and during such problems, the source bank asks you to contact the destination bank, and the destination bank will point a finger to the source bank. And most of the apps do not have good customer service (no live support), so I've to shoot mails and call up each bank, then talk to the customer care of the service where i was making the payment (say, Yatra), and since there's zero coordination, the transaction remains hanging in the air.

Now, to be fair to npci, I've never actually lost money because of such failures. If the payment doesn't go through, I'll get the refund in anywhere between 1-5 days. But this doesn't solve my problem. The transaction is still a failure and I've lost my service.


After losing out on flight tickets, credit card payments and hotel bookings multiple times, I've stopped using UPI for any transactions over 1000 rupees. Now I'm trying to get my landlord to take payment through NetBanking. I've switched back to cards and safe to say, they are performing just as good as they were when UPI got implemented. 


So my question is, are you all facing similar problems as well? Is UPI still as reliable as it used to be?

And how am I gonna access a psychiatrist ...

Please help me ... If any one here is a psychiatrist or in this field .. please advise me on what to do 


It started a few days ago , I was fine and doing well Until I watched a movie about someone being falsely accused , I got intrusive thoughts that I might get falsely accused too , and my fear was escalated when I realised that I have a pretty suspicious post history on reddit and search history too , so I got really scared that I'd be falsely accused , so I did a few Google searches about weather or not i'm being tracked by the government or not , and it came with scary search results so my intrusive thoughts shifted to being spied on and falsely accused at the same time , now I don't have a lot of friends but I really value the few friends I have so I was scared that this would hurt my reputation and I would lose my current friends and not be able to make new friends either .. then later on I got so anxious and thought ""what if I am actually a criminal ? The idea didn't bother me at first but then I googled ""surpressed memories"" and I got pretty scared as well , and had the thought that I might be actually a horrible criminal and have surpressed memories of it because I cant remember doing anything bad .... I had additional intrusive thoughts as well like this world being a hallucination and that maybe in reality I'm doing some terrible things .... I was extremely scared and had a lot of anxiety ... Then later on it shifted to my current fear .. That is going to *** .... This fear is based on a dream I had a few months ago I had a dream that my life would crumble down.... And that I'd be rejected by everyone and that I'd never reach my loved ones .... I was really going through panic in my dream ... And was contemplating suicide or drugs too .... There was a figure in that dream that resembled ryuk from the anime death note ... Who was mocking me about my fate.....Right now I feel similar to that dream ..... But I have reasons to believe that this might be true Because I've been noticing various signs like scary typos while typing and ads with specific wordings etc and events like me bringing a new charger and it not working afterwords ... And me having to lay down in a specific position so it charges while using it ... Having to eat bad food etc and My mom acting weird I saw two other anime called hell girl and Babylon which scared me too ... Because both plots resemble what I'm going through I'm really anxious at this point and don't know what to do .... I'm scared and always have a feeling like I'm being watched .... I even thought to myself that if I wear this specific clothing then something scary would happen and well ... I saw the hell girl cast and had a ""hallucination"" of making a deal with the devil .. or taking a loan from a hell bank now I'm scared of going to a bank or taking out a loan I was interested in anime and now I'm scared of it .... I was interested in banking stuff and now I'm scared .... Even now I'm witnessing scary typos too .... I don't know what to do... One reason I'm scared of getting help is because ... I think that if I let my guard down or feel relieved ... Something terrible would happen ... And in Babylon ... Help from nowhere worked for the protagonist almost .... This seems similar to me .. and I'm scared of it and hope it's not .... 


Even now I'm witnessing scary signs like word suggestions , scary co incidences , someone with the username ""naively idealistic"" messaged me with kind words ... This seemed like a supernatural warning .... One thing I forgot to mention is that a main character in hell girl three vessels saw her ambitions crumble and her succeeding the hellgirl .... I don't want this to happen with me ..

Fuck I'm even having scary medical symptoms  and disturbing  typos and  signs as if telling me to not Talk about this .... .. This all seems so scary and frightening ... I'm really scared please help me

Edit : it seems to keep on getting scarier ...


Edit : I'm scared of feeling even slightly relieved or talking about this because im scared of its  repucussions if any.. it's really frightening ..

Edit : I felt a strong earthquake that seems like only I felt , idk what this was .... Now I'm really scared even more ...

Edit : just remembered that there was another character in hellgirl who was accused of something and sent to hell , don't know if falsely or not ... Now I'm even more scared..

Edit : since I seem to be more concerned about being accused... And at times I'm not much anxious.... I'm really scared.... Fuck ... I am more scared about being accused ... I don't know .... What If I appeared like a manipulator or appeared normal to a psychiatrist ?.... 

Edit : what if I'm looking like one right now ? Please .... I'm suffering .... I'm not lying about being anxious ...

Edit : more scary signs and scary thoughts ... For example ""I'm going"" and ""I'm goin"" was in a text bar ... And my phone discharged too ... And some scary  warning etc  kind of typos ..... Even when typing now ( oof more typos) and non typos in some sentences .. even now scary signs

Edit : The earthquake was in Delhi  my area 
.... The epicenter too .... Which is scary ... Inmany ways

Edit : many of the themes in that anime seem really scary and similar .... Like regret etc ....and people sending others to hell but realising their mistakes since they go to hell too .... By doing so... And other situations leading to them regretting their decisions .... I'm getting so many scary typos and signs while typing this ...

Edit : I had  a dream when I was sleeping recently about being a big criminal on the run ... And I had a dream about reading about hellgirl on Wikipedia and how disturbing it is and Hell is , I had a negative dream again wearing the same sheet ... That I wore when I had my previous negative dreams .... It's so frightening .... And I had so many scary typos typing this.... Edit of this edit : the typos were really scary like warnings even now I think 


Edit : I'm still seeing scary signs etc .... For example a sinister smile shape in a cup of tea etc .... I'm really scared .... Im scared that maybe   innocent people can be sent to hell too.  

Edit : I saw something related to the thing I think I should have avoided .... Related to banking kind of ... And I'm scared I made the wrong decision by doing so maybe ... Even my phone discharged before .... For many minutes .... Im  scared that maybe this is a pattern or symbolic or manipulated ...

Edit : still witnessing scary signs

Edit : the second previous edit is scaring me ... I'm scared that maybe I shouldn't have seen stuff related to banking ... Because it seems so symbolic and patterned

Edit : I remember being really jelous of my cousin ... And hating him ... In hell girl you can send people to hell like i said .... I don't want to be in that situation .... I have an ambition that I'm afraid of having crumbled ..... I'm unable to put it in words right now and that's what scares me because of the repucutions if any ... Of it ... I'm having negative thoughts of my close people betraying me ..... Or looking like they betrayed me or crumbling my ambition ... And i doing something terrible like sending them to hell .... And going to hell as well .... I'm seriously scared ..... 

Edit : I even had scary medical symptoms again ....
 

Edit : I'm sorry to everyone who I've wished hell and anything bad on .... I'm sorry ..... 

Edit : I tried to copy paste this to 7 cups forums but it didn't work.... I wonder what it could mean 

Edit : I saw some things ..
 That I'm scared of there .... Now I'm scared ... I don't even wanna talk about it but I'm scared that this means something and might have repucutions ....

Edit : I'm scared almost everytime and scared that I'm being watched supernaturally ....

Edit : soooooooooo I was watching hentai ... And a poster had the username ""lifeanddeathsworld"" and another ""deadstar"" ... Scary....",2020-04-13 20:45:00

People who used to feed the daily wagers have stopped for various reasons.

Economy went south with no chance of recovering in near future.

Whatever is left, is beyond affordable and production lines are stopped.

How long will we survive on warehouse stocks? How much time before the lockdown ends? When will the shelves be restocked (even for them to be it will take couple of weeks after lockdown ends)?

Let's not even talk about job market and havoc around it.

I believe more will die because of lockdown starvation than COVID-19. I am really anxious and worried about this scenario. Are my thoughts rational?

I am working for my current company for almost 1 year now. 2 weeks ago, I put in my resignation because I got a much better job at another company. However, since we have to serve a 2 month notice period, I'm still here for 6 more weeks.

Anyway, ever since I put in my notice, management has been watching me like a hawk. They've assigned me work that's way beyond my paygrade and stuff that I clearly cannot do. Since I had resigned, I was feeling very carefree, and left 2 hours early on Friday without notifying anyone. But this is a pretty regular happening in my company on Fridays. Anyway, I got a super passive aggressive email from my boss about that last night, even though this wasn't a problem in the past year when I left slightly early.

I talked to a friend who had left a few months back and he essentially told me management at the company is very vindictive and the same stuff was done to him. Apparently he had to fight tooth and nail to not get terminated while on notice.

Now, I don't really care if I do get fired, I have another job lined up after all. What really scares me is that the other company's offer is at least in some part based on a background check, of which my current company's service letter (or some call it experience letter) is a part of. That is, I don't want them looking at the service letter and it says ""Employee was terminated"" because that'll look bad. Same if they call up my current company.

So what exactly is written on a service letter? Just the position, start date and end date? Or does it also mention your performance or if you were terminated? And if a company calls another company to make sure you were working there, will the previous company mention that you were fired, or simply confirm whether you were working or not?

BSNL ADSL Broadband : Thoughts,8,AskIndia,Night_Falcon_07,fx0ws1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx0ws1/bsnl_adsl_broadband_thoughts/,16,1586354529.0,"Okay, so since the past few weeks, I've been getting really pathetic speeds on my BSNL Broadband. I know it's because of the overload in internet traffic due to the nationwide lockdown, and I'm not complaining about that. I use a 2.4 GHz router, it's practically ancient at this point, but I never really felt the need to change, and I'm regretting that decision now. The speeds had gotten really slow lately and I was getting disconnected every five minutes.

But then, all of a sudden, the internet went out. Poof. Gone. There was a solid red light in my router, instead of green. Then it would switch back and forth between a red light and no light at all. I figured it was because I hadn't paid my bills for March owing to the COVID-19 scare, it sorta slipped my mind. So two days back, I paid my bills via Amazon, for BOTH March and April altogether, and the Internet still hasn't returned. I tried tweaking around with the DNS settings, resetting my router, checking the ADSL splitter and cables, so far, nothing's worked. I tried calling the BSNL Broadband Customer Service . No one's picked up. Even though I've heard that telecom companies are supposed to stay open amidst the lockdown.

I'm seriously pissed at BSNL right now. I've had to use mobile hotspots these past few days, and its really inconvenient.

Living in Silchar, Assam, I don't really have much choice with high-speed FITH connections, (aside from JioFiber, I guess?), and I've got a soft spot for BSNL too, but this is getting on my nerves. Either give me my Internet back, or give me my money back.

I was a Hathway Broadband user but had to cancel it due to some issues. After I stopped recharging, I sent a mail to them (In October 2019)  to close the connection. It didn't help as they kept on calling me and harrassing me over calls to recharge. I tried everything to make them to stop calling me, sent out mails, tweets, calls everything bit nothing worked. So, I had to block all the numbers they called from. Eventually everything stopped.

- Fast forward to March 2020 -

I got a sudden mail from their legal team that says they are going to file a case if I don't return the router. The problem is that I had shifted my house since then and the router is lost. Anyways In their mail there is a doc which needed to be filled for pickup. I filled that form in order to negotiate with the pickup partner for the router.

- I found private data breach -

In the Google doc that I've filled my information I've found that if you go to edit response you are able to read all the information of all the people who've filled that form. It is just lying there open to all. It contains addresses and phone numbers of around 700 users. I think that this is private data and no company can make it public like this.

I am extremely tired of my life. I don't have motivation to do anything.,32,AskIndia,throwaaccounttt,fu98rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu98rm/i_am_extremely_tired_of_my_life_i_dont_have/,9,1585952454.0,"I don’t have anyone to share my feelings, so I guess I can reduce my burden by sharing them here.

I am currently a final year student in a local state level government college in my city. The lesser said about my college, the better. I guess hell would be better than this sorry excuse of a college. During my 12th, like every engineering aspirant, I wanted to get into any IIT or NIT. But I had taken no coaching, so I had no guidance and messed up my counselling. In the end, I was offered a north eastern NIT. I was hesitant to go there. I wanted to take a drop, but my parents did not agree to it. So I took admission in a govt college in my city and stayed in my home, and prepared alongside college.

I was not able to perform well in JEE-Mains, but secured a rank in top 7k in JEE advanced and got IIT Varanasi Metallurgical in last round. Though I was not satisfied with my result, I was satisfied with an IIT seat. But my parents did not allow me to change college. According to them, metallurgical at even an old IIT was way worse than electrical branch in my current college. I tried to reason with them but to no avail. I was forced to continue in my college. 2nd semester exams overlapped with JEE Advanced date and I performed extremely bad, and got multiple backs.

I was heartbroken. I could not understand how I came to be in my current situation, even after working so hard. I used to wake up at 03:30 in the morning, study from 4 am till 7 am and leave for college at 8 am. I used to skip my lunch and study during lunch break. I returned home around 6 pm, and studied after 7 pm till the time I was extremely exhausted. I used to commute for 2 hours daily, so I revised my notes sitting in autos. Even after giving it my all, I had got only 7k rank in advanced. But now all my efforts were down the drain as I could not even utilize my rank. I felt I was depressed. I am ashamed to say but whenever I was alone, tears started streaming automatically across my face.

My cgpa in first year was extremely bad. To compensate for it, I had to forget my sorrows and start working hard again. I worked moderately hard for next 2 years and increased my percentage to 80. My college has no placements for core branches. So I knew I was on my own. I was confused whether to prepare for Gate or CAT. I had no interest  in engineering or management. In my college, almost all students in core branches prepared for GATE. Although I was not interested in my core subjects, but I started preparing for Gate halfheartedly. On Sundays, to relieve stress, I used to give a mock test of CAT. Solving quant questions somehow relaxed me. I gave CAT 2019 without any expectations. Imagine my surprise when I secured 99.8+ percentile in the exam. I was extremely happy on seeing the result, I had not even calculated my marks before seeing the result.

The GATE exam was in the first week of February, and my IIM A and IIM C interviews were in second week. I could not decide where should I focus. I wasted very valuable time in my state of indecisiveness. At last, I decided to prepare for IIM interviews. I performed badly in my Gate exam as well as my interviews, Looking back, I think that this is all my fault. I had no knowledge about what the IIMs expect from students. I realized the importance of position of responsibility and extra curricular activities after the CAT results. I had nothing to flaunt except my CAT result. I am certain that I would not be able to convert my best calls based on my performance in interviews. Even in Gate, I got 800ish rank which is not good enough for anything, as I am a general candidate.

So now I guess that I will have to drop a year as I have no job and cannot hope to get any, considering the current economic situation. Even after working so hard for the past 6 years in my life, I would be another jobless graduate. It is this thought that eats my heart. I don’t have anything to console myself, to give me motivation. I feel like a zombie, waking up without a purpose in life, going about like everything is normal. This burden is too much to bear.",2020-04-04 03:50:54

The plot twist: my bosses who own the company have multiple Pvt Ltd cos, llps etc. My boss lets call him av, is also a director in a big Pvt Ltd Co(let's call this company k) in our city. I went for a job in that Co only but he thought he'd use me in his personal businesses. He asked me there was no need for an accountant but his person company(h, a comparatively smaller company, owns a few businesses here and there, 40cr turnover and recently opened a petrol pump). Now av being in charge of k, thought why should they give away any chance of making money so they incorporated E, a software solution company, with av, his father and another Delhi based man being its directors. Now come to the real thing.

I went for a job in k, he offered me a job in h with a condition that I'll be on the payroll of E. Having dropped out and being in desperate need of money, I joined for 11.5k. 3 months down the road (March 19)and I got a raise and now I was at 12.5k.

Now this February, they told me I'd be working at the petrol pump, and I obliged. The first month was outrageous. I forgot what a clock is. Working tirelessly along with the hr(friend and business partner of av). Hr, in the beginning said, ""how comfortable are you working a 12 hour shift, given that your renumeration will increase accordingly?"" I said if I'm getting paid more, of course I'd work for 12 hours. He said, I won't be here once everything comes on track, and we're thinking of maybe promoting you, making you the manager here.
Yesterday, he came and said, we're thinking of a different option, let's get your working hours back to 9, and compensate(mind the word) for the month of February:2000 cash that'll be shown as expense in the books, will that be OK?

Also, last night I got the text for my salary. It was 10.9k. I was infuriated. Our mortgage is 11.5k a month and rest of my salary was used for conveyancing to and fro office. Other exps are taken care of by my dad's pension(its lesser than my salary) I texted the senior accountant(he's a personal accountant sort of, takes care of all the businesses accounting and is on payroll of K, earns 35-45k a month.) he said it was deduction for PF. I said, ""two things, I want to opt out from PF and I want my salary from the company I'm working for."" he said he'll talk to av and hr.

What should I do in this situation. Should I look for another job, as I'm yet to finish my graduation. I was a physics undergrad, but I learnt accounts in 3 fucking months and mind you, I confused debit and credit my entire life. But this time, my life depended on it. Though I have ample skills for surviving a job, and have worked tirelessly in the last one year. There have been a shit load of problems in my personal life as well that are irrelevant here, but now I can search for another job.

What should I do?

Another thing, I was selected for INSPIRE scholarship in 2013,the year I passed out of school. I don't know what you guys will say about this, but I want to return that award, because I didn't receive a single fucking rupee and ended up dropping out of college due to financial crisis. I was in a reputed University of NCR. but I doubt anyone would give a shit, as our country is all about three things : politics, politics, and politics. Students, and anyone else can fuck right off.

Any answers are appreciated!

1)  How are people getting food?  There have been news reports of the police being allowed to use violence on people leaving their homes, and on food delivery drivers, so how is anyone eating?

2)  Are there still shanty towns for the poor?  How are they coping with this?  From what I recall, those areas don't have pantries and fridges that they could stock up in a time of quarantine.

3)  In your opinions, does the average Indian believe this is a real thing, believe it's exaggerated, believe this is a government conspiracy, believe this is end times?  How does the average Indian redditor differ?  I don't follow this page often, so I have no idea.

4)  Has there been a reasonable transition to working from home for those in amenable industries?  Who is considered an ""essential worker"" there?

5)  Are people who require treatment receiving it, to the best of your knowledge?  There were also reports of hospitals turning away presumptive COVID patients, and I have no ability to discern what's being blown out of proportion and what's true.

6)  Do you feel like this is helping to unify the country, or is it exacerbating tensions with various groups?  

7)  Are people wearing masks when they're out?  Are they allowed to go out?

8)  Is the pollution diffusing with the quarantines?  

9)  Is tech so widespread now that you feel that the remote villages have an idea of what's going on?

But what's done is done and there's no use debating it further, atleast until all of this blows over.

What I am worried about is people feeling like they are being repressed against their best interests and retaliating en masse.

Currently, the people are ignoring the Lockdown due to two reasons.

1. They don't understand the seriousness of the situation. 

2. They don't have enough supplies and/or are worried about their survival

The Police cracking down on them using violence might instill the idea that the Lockdown is implemented not for their benefit. A lack of certainty about essential commodities adds more fuel to the fire. Reading about the situation in Goa, I couldn't help but feel that the people are on the verge of their breaking point. And if the situation in the Hospitals reaches a point where, like in Italy, the Doctors have to choose whose life to save, I can't imagine how the people would react.

I don't mean to cause unnecessary panic or worry to the people reading this post. I just want to know whether the Government has considered this ( I am trying to be optimistic here ) and have a proper plan in place to avoid it. I would also like to know if people like me can help spread awareness and help alleviate the situation.",2020-03-30 01:28:47

She has a large FD that was set to mature with interest on April 1, will she get that in her account at least, or not? I'm so scared I'm shaking rn :(

Edit: so I went to the bank and they told us FDs etc are safe and will be deposited in the account. ATMs are non-functional/empty, you need cheques to withdraw cash. Bank lady was reassuring everyone that the money was safe, it was just a withdrawal limit for a short period of time until the sale goes through because they need to investigate everything before going ahead.

Amazon Prime video is censoring content and the world needs to take notice,1125,Entertainment,that_70_show_fan,5ko5tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ko5tu/amazon_prime_video_is_censoring_content_and_the/,263,1482926165.0,"First of all, this is only case where I found that Amazon Prime is censoring their content. If they are doing the same in other countries please let me know in the comments. 

India has severe restrictions on what can be showed on TV and what cannot, but rather than the state directly censoring... the TV channels censor their own content. [We have had instances where a channel has been taken off air for showing the wrong map of India.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Al-Jazeera-taken-off-air-for-five-days-for-showing-wrong-India-map/articleshow/47015509.cms) These TV channels take this the extreme, like censoring the word ""beef,"" blurring visuals of beef in cooking shows, blurring visuals of lingerie, etc. 

Amazon has implemented this tactic to online streaming content despite India having no laws censoring online videos(aside from child porn). [The government of India has publicly stated that they have no intention of censoring online videos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5i2fi0/ib_ministry_we_are_not_considering_censorship_of/)  

In response to criticism of censoring their content, Amazon response is:

> ""We will keep Indian cultural sensitivities in mind while offering this content to customers""

They completely censored an entire segment from Ep 4 of *The Grand Tour* as it showed the carcass of a cow. The runtime of this episode is 30 minutes as opposed to the original 62 minutes. In addition to that they have blurred any instances of nudity. 

They are setting an extremely dangerous precedent by being a willing participant in censoring content. This is the wet dream of the government of India and other countries where the state wants censorship but do not have the resources to implement it on their own. [This comes at a time when Holloywood is bending over backwards to appease the Chinese censor board\(SAPPRFT\)](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/05/18/407619652/how-chinas-censors-influence-hollywood).     

As someone who is involved in fighting against censorship, this is a serious blow as I see the rest of the industry following suit. 

India is still a small market for Amazon, but it needs to know that there are many who oppose any form of censorship by principle. I hope people in the west notice how their companies behave if they see potential to make some extra money.

Now, Steam shows game prices in INR and accepts every damn card in our country. Thank, Lord Gaben. I spent 1890 INR so far and obviously close to getting broke but got some amazing titles like WWE2K16, Mortal Kombat XL, Portal 2 and Trials Fusion for dirt cheap prices. 

What did you guys buy? How much did you spend? 

Edit 1 : Cheapshark.com - for those who don't know it yet. It doesn't list prices in INR but is very helpful to keep track of game discounts on Steam, Origin, GOG or any platform. You can set reminders as well when your favorite title goes on sale and see its all-time low to wait for a purchase. ",2016-12-29 01:59:09

A lovely morning in a rather chaotic Bangalore,180,Entertainment,_init1,60kzmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/60kzmh/a_lovely_morning_in_a_rather_chaotic_bangalore/,56,1490091264.0,"It has been 3 months since I arrived in Bangalore. Being a freelancer, I have had the chance of not being a part of the large office going crowd here. Observing choked roads, small flats, crowded streets and being overcharged for usual stuff, I had felt gloomy for some time.

It is funny that going to St. John's Hospital once, made me like it more than the general city, all for the large open compound and well maintained greenery.

So skipping the gym, I arrived at the Lalbagh Park this early morning. Entering the place I felt good leaving the general warmth, vehicle noise, gasoline smell and polluted air on the road. It was still a little dark when I entered, with people running, jogging and walking.

I always had earphones on in the gym, but here I didn't need it. I could hear different birds waking out of their sleep and getting on with their day. There is a lake here, with some duck families in it, so I sat beside it for a while, typing a part of this text. Saw a few squirrels chipping on something on the ground, saw a tree with a small tribe of monkeys. With the sunrise there were even more birds moving around. A walk around the lake certainly made me think of how we might chose to see just the negative and omit the positive. Bounded in the boxes of our perspective with our own thoughts echoed all around, we might be sometimes living in a false reality. It is advisable to take a step or two astray to be in touch with the truth.

The park is blessed with large trees, lush green garden, a lot of flowers on both sides of the pathway, well maintained gardens(succulents, bonsai, etc). The crowd is good as everybody here comes to appreciate the place and to have a peaceful beginning for the day. The place is definitely going to be one of the few places that I honestly like in the city and visit again. 


Edit: Lalbagh is free to visit till 9:00 in morning and evening 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm. :)",2017-03-21 15:44:24

Star Plus and Nayi Soch - normalizing abuse in under the farce of female empowerment. [NP],108,Entertainment,throwawayinditv,5gezdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5gezdw/star_plus_and_nayi_soch_normalizing_abuse_in/,61,1480878285.0,"Please don’t get me wrong, **I don’t think TV should be censored or more sanskarized.** Just making an observation on the TV show called Ishqbaaz.


 ****************

**Story**

The story is about three uber rich brothers and how they face numerous difficulties in their lives.  The oldest brother (Shivaay) is the main male lead. The female lead (Anika) is some sort of a manager of the family and does odd jobs for them. 

Shivay is very particular about ‘pedigree’ (yep, uses that word) and lineage. Serious casteist undertones. Many a times is abusive (even molests the female lead), and insulting to people without a good pedigree. 

Anika the female lead is portrayed as a self-respecting, self made woman who does not possess an iota of self-respect. A ‘modern’ ‘aaj ki ladki’ who bears the dehumanizing behaviour of the male lead for no apparent reason.  

Now the reason I am writing this is because I’ve witnessed my tween niece go absolutely cray cray over this show.  This is what happened on the show this week: https://gfycat.com/MenacingScrawnyGibbon

Here, the hero is blackmailing the heroine into marrying her because the original girl he was supposed to marry, rich and pedigreed Ria, has run away.  This was to save his reputation infront of the media and rich business partners. In order to further pressurise Anika, Shivaay also kidnaps her disabled 6 year old brother and threatens to murder him if Anika does not comply. And viewers are excited about the upcoming romance between them!


**************

**People behind the show:**


Producers

Karishma Jain- next to no information about her. Is she related to the Jain brothers?

Gul Khan- Jamia aliumni, has gone to make one [regressive show after the other]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gul_Khan_(producer)). She talks about her experience of being a muslim in India and the industry [here]( https://forum32.com/2013/08/gul-khans-interview-with-indian-express-an-insight-into-the-woman-behind-qubool-hai/). You would think that someone who’s belongs to a community that is misrepresented and misunderstood (according to her) would be mindful of the impact that her shows have. 

Actors

Surbhi Chandna plays the female lead. Twitter unverified and barely any insightful interview. Female actresses are the worst hypocrites. Will cry about equal pay and status and yet continue to do juvenile, demeaning roles which propagate women are in fact inferior to men. See the cycle? 

Nakuul Mehta plays the male lead. Boy this person is confusing. Rather proud of his Rajput lineage, he [Challenges mindsets that women belong to the kitchen,](https://twitter.com/NakuulMehta/status/776699297001725952) (verified twitter) and also glorifies characters that abuse and molest women on screen. Also stars in the extremely wannabe youtube series “I don’t watch tv” which in a condescending way shits on the very stupid people who do watch such tv shows. 

************

**Reactions of fans:**

Most stuff here is the reaction to this scene: https://gfycat.com/MenacingScrawnyGibbon

“Waiting for the day he realises his love for her.” 
“he is angry because he is in love”
“so rude I feel bad for the heroine”
“A feminist in me is so so furious after watching the epi that feel like slapping sso by myself also but deep inside I <3 him”

[“there was arrogance and all BUT there was fire”](http://imgur.com/fD7JR2m)


[“he pushed her badly and kept his foot beside her that was horrible” “now how is anika gonna love him”](http://imgur.com/LVWgGTp)



[if he is caring, he has anger too. as a girl i felt bad the way he talkd but soon everything will be ok](http://imgur.com/TnAqOBF) [this just gets me]


“shivay crossed all limits today” “anyway an interesting episode""


[Fans concerned that the couple’s theme romantic song is played during the abuse](http://imgur.com/jzG6tS8)


These young girls have internalized the notion that someone who loves you has the right to be abusive towards you. And even though some notice how rapey the hero is, is more of a villain for kidnapping the disabled kid brother, the audience is ready to let it go so that the ‘romance’ track can begin, all is forgotten, and the couple ends up together. 

One thing more, what if the male lead was a truck driver or a labourer in place of a rich businessman. Would these girls think it was ok to stay in an abusive relationship then?

I’ll be completely honest, I think this is Mani Ratnam’s best film in at least a decade. The complex characters, the brilliant music, the atmosphere that is set by each scene.

I applaud Ratnam for actually portraying an abusive relationship realistically. Realistically, there isn’t a big speech followed by a break-up. Realistically and unfortunately, you have victims staying in abusive relationships for multiple reasons. Real relationships don't have clear answers or clear cut happy endings. Real relationships are messy and complex. The ending isn’t truly a happy one. Dr. Leela warns VC in the farewell that they will destroy each other if they stay together. That’s what the core of the movie is. Two very flawed individuals who are staying together in a destructive relationship(a theme echoed in Ratnam’s similarly received masterpiece “Dil Se”).

Once again, I applaud Ratnam for portraying a very complex subject in a realistic, often painful manner. The beautiful frames and excellent music support this haunting tale on abusive relationships. I’m sure that Kaatru Veliyidai will be re-assessed in the years to come, similar to Mani Ratnam classics such as “Dil Se” and “Iruvar”, movies that were negatively received upon their release.",2017-05-25 16:58:51

Why India must seek LION,64,Entertainment,cbsxact7,5w4klp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5w4klp/why_india_must_seek_lion/,39,1488065591.0,"LION- Lost In Other Nation
I watched lion today, I simply enjoyed this movie with brilliant performances of Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman & Sunny Pawar(Young Saroo).
The story is not so complex as young Saroo gets lost and survive somehow to reach his new home Australia where a couple is waiting for him. 25 years later he tracks his root back to India with the help of Google Earth. 
That’s it a simple but elegant story which bagged 6 Oscar nominations including Best supporting actor & actress for Dev and Nicole respectively, And after two days no one will be surprised if LION wins few or all of them. While I was watching this movie a thought came in my mind, Why foreigners are making such successful films on India and Indians are still far away from nominations. Why?
Slumdog Millionaire was based on a book written by an Indian author, story was based on India but again outsiders grab the opportunity. Indian real life stories like Paan Singh Tomar brilliantly made but somehow not even sent to Oscar as authorities found some other movie better than it.
I think it’s time to transform the Bollywood for more Masaan like movies which are simple yet heart touching and beautifully captures the love along with a new level music by Indian Ocean. We know it’s important to make money but we also know that stories also helps in running a movie commercially. Kahaani was better because of its unique storyline and a new flavor to Indian audience. Gangs of Wasseypur was good because it shows the raw storyline with superb characters portrayal.
Rang De Basanti gives youth a patriotic feeling with new generation doing their role for nation. Udaan telling everyone to chase one’s dreams even your father is against it. 3 Idiots giving you a message that marks is not important your learning will help in your future troubles. 
I think this is the time for Bollywood to rethink the quality of movies rather than quantity. We already makes the highest number of movies in a year and not even a single movie to nominate us in prestigious Academy award. It’s time to show that Mother India was our tribute to every mother living in this country, Pyaasa portraying the best of Indian poetry by Guru Dutt and Anand giving you a new prospective of life. Let’s hope India will soon find his LION.

- Nation's fighting well, thanks to you folk's sacrifice. ""We the people of India"" means exactly this [Starting till 4 minutes in speech].
- India started screening for COVID before the first case. At 100 cases, we started isolation. At 500 cases, we did a lockdown for 21 days [6 minutes in speech]
- It's unfair to compare with other countries. However, if we compare, India is at a relatively good standing (by around _25 to 30 times_). [8 minutes in speech]. The lockdown and social distancing was expensive but worth it. Still, _the rate of spread is alarming_ [10 minutes in speech].
- Citizens, state governments, bodies have suggested and some have _already_ implemented an extension to lockdown. **Lockdown has been extended till 3rd May 2020** (under the _same circumstances and conditions_). [12 minutes in speech].
- We have to avoid the spread of COVID in regions. Death due to this must be even more worrisome. _We must stay vigilant with current and emerging hotspots_. New hotspots will bring problems. 
    - **Stronger constraints and implementation of lockdown till 20th April 2020**. Essential services and operations can resume for areas of lower risks (under conditions for going out). _If any traces of COVID, the lockdown shall be reimposed_. [16 minutes in speech].
- _A guideline shall be released by tomorrow_ (_15th April 2020_). Major steps are taken to _help the poor and needy_. The government has helped them through various funds, specially farmers. There are efforts being made for helping farmers, supply chain is being improved [18 minutes in speech]
- We've already organized over 1L hospital beds and 600+ COVID hospitals. Scientists are encouraged to help in these times of crisis [20 minutes in speech].

### Help needed in 7 areas 
The public is encouraged to focus on the following areas [start 22 minutes in speech]:

1. _Extra care of the elderly_ in the house
2. **Obey lockdown**. Use **homemade** masks.
3. Improve immunity.
4. Download ""Aarogya Setu"" [mobile app](https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/) and encourage others to download it.
5. Help the poor and needy
6. Don't terminate employment of workers under you
7. Respect the front line workers (police, healthcare professionals, etc.)

**Please follow the above till 3 May 2020** [till 24 minutes in speech].


## Key points observed:
- PM Narendra Modi were wearing a mask which was a muffler (*Not an N95 respirator or a surgical mask*) in the beginning of the address.
- _Started at 10 AM_ and went on _till 10:25 AM_ on 14th April 2020.",2020-04-14 18:49:38

The Tablighi Jamaat’s (TJ) reckless and irresponsible conduct in the current coronavirus outbreak has surprised many within the Muslim community. The Tablighis have largely been an apolitical and disciplined lot with a penchant for holding large conclaves where after-life matters are deliberated and discussed. However, of late, TJ has been witnessing an intense power struggle between its chief Maulana Saad Kandhlawi and a powerful lobby consisting of the ‘shoura’ (executive council).

Saad, a great-grandson of TJ founder Maulana Illyas, reportedly wanted to be one-up on his rivals and ignored saner voices to defer the Delhi-Nizamuddin congregation. Instead, his supporters ensured crowd mobilisation from southern states like Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Kerala, with disastrous consequences. Maulana Saad's role in the TJ headquarters sharing a wall with the Nizamuddin police station has been as dubious. The police reportedly were regular beneficiaries of food and other goodies coming from the TJ office which blurred their vision to act swiftly and decisively.

My problem is a very obvious one: We are NOT testing enough. Because of this, we don’t actually have a conception of which zones are red, orange or green.

The [Mortality rate of Covid-19 in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms)  is 3.05, according to this [article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms).

The mortality rate in US is about 3.57, in Italy around 12 and in UK it's more than 12.(according to the above article)

so about 3 people die per 100 cases in India. It's scary! but not too much.

currently, mortality rate is calculated by number of death per number of cases .

    mortality rate = Total Death / Total cases

currently in world, **1,806,436** active cases and **111,722** deaths.(the curve is nowhere near flat)

mortality rate = 111722/1806436 = 6.18% worldwide.

so about 6 people die per 100 cases worldwide. It's scary! still not too much.

let's assume an [infection rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) of 20% (20 percent of population would get infected in a span of [2 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif)). 25% is the infection rate for Spanish influenza and it didn't spread to many country as covid-19, the social distancing was not that great before and there were [three waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif).

&#x200B;

now, 20% of 7.7 billion people is 1.4 billion (very huge) and 6% of 1.4 billion is 84 million(estimated death toll). 

realistically, if the infection rate is brought down to 1%(by social distancing, lock-down, etc) the death toll would still be 4.2 million. (stay the f\*ck inside home, seriously)

&#x200B;

now, my real panic is that the current mortality rate calculation takes total active cases into account( the people who got infected and are still in hospital waiting for outcome.) eventually these people will either die or get cured.

Doesn't it make sense that we should only consider the cases which had outcome for mortality rate calculation?

    mortality rate = total dead / (total discharged or cured+total dead)

In this case, 

current mortality rate = 111,722 / (413,222+111,722) = 21.3% (that's huge) (numbers from [worldometer](https://imgur.com/a/E2HZnAI))

this changes everything.

now, if the infection rate is 1%(more likely estimate) the death toll would be 16.4 million.(holy f\*uck)

which makes this one of the worst pandemics in history. 

In [India](https://imgur.com/a/vOkmjyH), 

mortality rate = 331/(1080+331) = 23.45% (which is very high, above world mean) (why are scientists saying we have low mortality rate?)

Did gov officials know about this?  or they know and they are keeping it silent to not cause any panic?

BTW, the actions taken by Indian gov is by far the best in the world.(as far as i researched) . they did bring down the infection rate by a huge factor.

&#x200B;

please help me with these questions:

* Am i doing the calculation correct or did i miss any variable? 
* Does India have huge asymptomatic cases, which were not reported?
* How did china contain this? did china actually contain this or lying about the numbers? 
* because the numbers in china are nowhere close to other countries. their mortality rate (by second method - only calculating outcomes) is 4% while for the rest of the world is 21%. it never crossed 5% at any time(very suspicious). Their mortality rate is low all the way? why all the country have similar curve except china? 
* why India is relying on Chinese model in containing this Virus?  **India should not follow Chinese model** to contain this problem.(i know medical students who are lazy to do their maths). 
* how is it possible for China to contain this as the infection rate is very high .R0 = 2.2 for covid-19, based on Chinese study  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - 34,200 in 2018/19 (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).[chinese study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/) ,  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - [34,200 in 2018/19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).
* how can we model this in India? will India be f\*ucked if there were a community spread?

Can we get some volunteers who can send me materials on how to model this properly? I know data science, i can make a website. with your help i can make some valuable prediction on how this will unfold and will give you that information for free.

But the way we would all be coming out of this virus, just scares me too.  As per the current state of India. If the virus spreads like usa in our country. We would really go downhill.
I know our government is doing whatever they can. I am not against them. But if they don't start testing we are not getting out of it. Because in societies that are not monitored properly people still go out carefree. Roam around for walks. And it is just scary.
And the thing is that post corona if we survive there are more problems ahead of us. I just thinking our country is coming near recession. As i would be passing out that scares me. And surely somebody's gonna respond to china in one way or another regarding the virus.
Its just so much anxiety that keeps me stressed about this world.

This is my first post on reddit, although i have been following reddit for past 2 years. 

Countries like Czech republic and Taiwan have kept spread of virus under control by ensuring everyone wears it. This was a totally new thing for Czech Republic but as a nation they have responded amazingly. 

Me and my friends think, we will eventually have to do this in India, even after lockdown is removed. Also mass production and distribution of masks to all with take time. 

 We all have time and can contribute to this by all making a DIY mask. There are studies which clearly say that it reduces the growth rate of masks. 

We have started a #masks4allChallenge on FB and Twitter along the lines of Ice bucket Challenge which has following steps

\- Make a DIY mask  
\- Share with someone in your surrounding  
\- Tag 3 friends to take up the challenge and ask them to share in their timeline

>The last fortnight has been unusually busy for psychiatrists and mental health professionals, who are flooded with distress calls from men and women confined to their restricted spaces

Anxiety, stress, fear of consequences, loneliness, failure, uncertainty of career, and restlessness, etc are some of the complaints they seek professional solutions to.

He has been receiving calls personally on how to handle the isolation and loneliness and feels that people need to just calm down and engage themselves productively at their homes.


>Brahmananda Rao, chief operating officer, said they expect a lot of calls from alcohol addicts. “Addicts do not know who to talk to or how to handle themselves or get cured. Only a counsellor can guide them to fight addiction. We help them with remedies and choices available in government facilities. Not all need to go to the hospital.”

There is no difference this year either.

In fact the US has given special permission for US embassies to process VISA’s for doctors admitted to Residency(PG) with priority and without delay. They of course realize their own shortage of health professionals and they are stealing both talent and money from 3rd world countries.

However this year with the onslaught by COVID 19 yet to wall perhaps the GOI and people of India ought to reconsider this policy, most of these doctors require permission from the Union Home Ministry to qualify for J-1 Visa.”

TL;DR: The US has made special exception to their strict VISA regimes to recruit young doctors from third world countries in the face of the epidemic to ensure they have no shortfall of physicians. India should do the same and temporarily halt young doctor migration till the threat of COVID has subsided.",2020-04-13 07:26:38
