#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

I'm a Muslim residing outside of India, I spoke to my parents today and it broke my heart. 

While everyone took part in whatever happened at 9 PM yesterday, my family took part in it entirely out of FEAR. Fear of being singled out if any of the lights in our house were switched on even by mistake. My mom switched off all the lights 5 minutes before 9 PM and double checked it, if she hadn't left anything on even by mistake. Call this paranoia or whatever, my family doesn't deserve this.

And, we live in one of the most safest neighborhoods in Mumbai.

So Kudos! The Islamaphobia has paid off, my family feels unsafe in its own home :)",2020-04-06 18:13:11

Isn't it just fucking great how companies like Ola valued at around USD 10 Billion desperately needs donations from people like us to pay their drivers wages amounting to 30cr?,30,Business/Finance,voodoodopetrain,fw14l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw14l3/isnt_it_just_fucking_great_how_companies_like_ola/,5,1586217117.0,"And I know that a lot of upper management in the company has donated  (total amounting to 20cr.)  It still doesn't make any sense that the larger part of the Fund had to be crowdfunded when the company could take care of the whole amount and more while barely taking a hit.

Retaining your employees in times of crisis is the responsibility of the employer and Ola is more than equipped to deal with such a situation. This means what they are doing is simultaneously putting the pressure on their customers TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES SALARY while acting like caring, charitable employers.

And don't even talk about the CEO forgoing an entire year of his salary. When you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country , this gesture looks a lot more like what it actually is: cheap PR bullshit. And let's not forget after forgoing his salary for a year his net worth remains at around 3100 crore.

Now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""What are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""What are some badass tweets during Covid-19"". It's filled with young Indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  Multiple answers ""completely"" blaming Muslims for Coronavirus ( Tablighi Jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )  

Then not to forget some quorans who think of themselves as some sort of celebrity. Quora is still fine if you read posts from non-Indian writers although it's sad that the quality of it has declined greatly.",2020-04-06 23:54:31

I live with my sister and brother in law in Chennai. My brother in law came from USA on 15th march 2020. After he came he had health check-up. He is healthy with no symptoms. 

2 days before few government officials came and stick home quarantine sticker outside our home. They said all the members in the house cant go out side till April 10th.

From past 3 days. i started having severe stomach pain. I had ulcer in my stomach an year back. I spoke with my an local doctor on phone and got few tablets. But the pain is still there.

Today I am planning to go to  gastroenterologist and have treatment. My sister is saying not to break the quarantine and wait till April 10. I can't sleep at night because of the pain. I cant imagine waiting till April 10.

Do I have to face any legal issues if I break the quarantine (in case my apartment neighbors compalains)?

Please suggest me what to do? Thanks.

UPDATE: EDIT :

I have booked appointment with doctor. I will be meeting with him at 6.30pm. thanks for all the suggestions.
Many of you suggesting to call an ambulance. But it makes situation messy in our apartment. The day government officials came to stick the quarantine sticker ,all the neighbours and apartment people got panicked. If an ambulance come they will decide that I am COViD_19 positive.

 Just came from hospital guys. Doctor gave injection. He gave tablets for 5 days. I am feeling better now. Thanks everyone.",2020-04-06 20:57:15

A Small Rant,42,Non-Political,_F1r3Fly_,fvvaog,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvvaog/a_small_rant/,6,1586191931.0,"I love how people can play the game of 'Simon says...', banging utensils, lighting diyas and who knows what next and assume that they have done their part and feel satisfied. The fact that they can attribute terms like solidarity, unity, improving morale and paying homage to the medical personnel is nothing more than spitting in the wound. 

So, I've seen a lot of people calling doctors as gods, heroes and saviours right? Now assume yourself in the shoes of a doctor, you are now working in a hospital where there's a shortage of PPE's, N95 masks etc. You are walking, with inadequate protection, among 100's of sick people who might potentially be infected. Everyday you're working 10-12 hour shifts, barely getting any rest, all while an uncertainty looms in the back of your head if you are even going to get through this pandemic alive. Then you see all these people doing all kinds of weird shit and cheering you on to walk in to that death trap again. How would you feel? 

If your idea of being a hero is to sacrifice themselves, then never call them that. See them as humans, humans just like you and me, humans with families, goals and aspirations, humans with a desire to live to see another day. If anything, heroes like them are meant to be protected, so that they can do their jobs, not sacrificed. 

Lighting diyas because you are bored of this lockdown? Hell yeah. Banging utensils because you wanted to have some fun? Hell yeah. But dont you dare mock the people battling in the frontlines, by justifying your shenanigans with meaningless words that fit your narrative. If you really have that uncontrollable itch to do something about this situation, either use your social media to demand for more testing, more protection gears for the hospitals or

These Corona virus events are not the best way to judge Modi’s popularity. Hear me out.,17,Politics,roamingoninternet,fvxn3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvxn3m/these_corona_virus_events_are_not_the_best_way_to/,1,1586203896.0,"I have seen a lot of commentary online about how these taali banging and candlelight events show Modi’s unparalleled popularity and what it means for the future of our democracy. While it is true Modi is an extremely popular politician, I don’t think these events are the best way to measure it. Here is why:

* To begin with, most national leaders see a spike in their popularity when the country is facing a crisis. This is commonly known as [Rally 'round the flag effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect). (For example, Trump, even after his colossal mismanagement in dealing with the Corona virus outbreak, has seen an increase in his approval ratings). Sadly, this makes the pandemic a good opportunity for populists and fascists to seize more power, and that should worry us. ([For Autocrats, and Others, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/europe/coronavirus-governments-power.html))

* Only a small percentage of people understand the semi-political nature of these events. For most people these were non-political events to fight Corona virus. Many people who might vote for other parties also took part in these events for a variety of reasons, including and not limited to love for the country (Rally 'round the flag effect), peer pressure, manufactured consent through media, boredom etc. 

* These events happened at a time when the entire country is under lockdown (something like this probably wouldn't be as successful as it was if there was no lockdown). People are locked in the house and glued to the TVs. Modi Govt used this situation to communicate and seek support for his events by non-stop media coverage. It didn’t matter which news channel you watched in the last few weeks, you couldn’t escape the marketing for these events. Dozens of popular film stars, sportspersons, religious leaders, etc were deployed to spread awareness and seek support for these “non-political” events. I doubt many of these celebrities will openly lend their support for Modi’s other openly political projects like CAA or NRC.

* Many news channels also portrayed the act of lighting the lamps as a prayer to the God to help fight the virus. Given how religious this country is and the situation we are in, the message was naturally persuasive for many people. **This is what really forced some in my family to light the lamps, not the message of solidarity or politics**. A few news outlets packaged yesterday’s event primarily as a prayer more than anything else and that worked.

* Opposition, whatever little is left, couldn’t openly oppose these events. The either unenthusiastically supported them or just kept quiet. That won’t necessarily be the case under normal circumstances.

* It is my assessment that the **devastating effects of the pandemic on the economy will have infinitely more impact on Modi's political future** then these marketing events. A lot of potential political damage to Modi on this would also depend on the performance of Congress as an opposition, and that’s a sign of worry given the state of the grand old party.

* Modi’s popularity is a by-product of a compromised media ecosystem. These PR stunts by Modi and the communalization of the outbreak proved that once again. So, in my view, **it’s the death of independent media that should worry us more than Modi’s popularity, as the latter stems from the former**. Sadly, I don’t see a solution for the media problem anytime soon. On the bright side, Modi’s popularity doesn’t automatically translate into victories in state elections for the party. We have seen that in the recent assembly elections where BJP lost despite major political events like the dilution of the Article 370 and the Ram Mandir verdict.

To conclude – No, 2024 Lok Sabha election results were not announced yesterday.",2020-04-07 01:41:36
Friends of decades have fallen for fake news and are actively demonizing the Muslim community. How did we come to this?,14,AskIndia,in3po,fvyodb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvyodb/friends_of_decades_have_fallen_for_fake_news_and/,4,1586208234.0,"The govt of India has failed miserably in protecting doctors nurses sanitation workers in the coronavirus pandemic.
Not enough PPEs, not adequate testing.
We are testing 27 per million
Compared to 67 power million in Pakistan.
Korea is testing more than 7000 per million.

Regarding the Tableeghi jamaat incident in Delhi, few points

1. The gathering happened much before the lockdown was announced
2. Once the lockdown was announced the gathering wanted to disperse and asked the sdm for vehicle passes. The sdm did not respond.
3. Foreign visitors allowed into the gathering without proper checks. They were the source of infection.
4. Once infected people were found in the gathering why were they all not quarantined by the administration. Why were they allowed to return to their own places before 2 weeks?

After the above incident, the ruling politicians and there IT cell have worked very hard to create the narrative that Muslims are the reason for the spread of corona cases in India. The total lack of preparedness from the government is being glossed over.

Old and out-of-context videos are being shared to demonize the Muslim community. https://altnews.in is filled with so many examples where the facts have been unearthed behind fake videos on WhatsApp and Facebook.

The above was for context

I made a comment in my old friends WhatsApp group that with the April 5, 9 p.m. details a Jalao ""initiative"", corona would surely be gone. With sarcasm.

The response that I got had enough proof that my well educated friends had totally fallen for fake news and truly hated the Muslim community from their gut. A Muslim man licking fruits to spread corona. A Muslim man spitting on police. All of these have been debunked on detail on alt news. But the recipients of these fake videos totally believe them. For them opIndia, WhatsApp and Facebook are like the gospel.

The amount of poison they spewed was phenomenal. When I engaged with fact checks, the response that I got was

I'd rather worry about my future than think of fully utilising my data package for the day.

This was my experience with ""friends"" of twenty years.

How did we come to this?

A wise friend told me that if you want to remain friends on WhatsApp then better not to discuss religion and politics. Maybe he was right.

Maybe this fake news shitstorm has truly blinded well educated individuals, for whom bigotry has become second nature now.

All arguments are based on the point where Modi is to blame and where the blame lies on the stupidity of People.

The main villain of this whole act is lurking shadows, the one that drives Modi to do these magnanimous gestures and the Bhakts going a step further.

The Villain is Social Media and its cheap/immediate Validation of People's Acts.

Modi is a wave on the Ocean of time, the one who is using the potential of this villain to the maximum. Who can stop the next person to emulate or even elevate Modi's Acts ?

This villain has encroached upon every aspect of Human life, be it Parents filming children in their age of innocence for Validation, teenagers risking themselves for a thumbs up, adults taking stands that they might not believe in real life.

And Everytime this villain shows it's magic, the real issues take a background. 

Why even this post is a form of that villain, where validation received by Internet strangers will give a high of Temporary Happiness and a false sense of Achievement.

Scientific temper vs Faith,41,Politics,nefrpitou,fvrv9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvrv9a/scientific_temper_vs_faith/,9,1586174853.0,"The following is an excerpt from a 1988 article on ""How to do research, at the MIT AI Lab"" (Link to the full article given at the end of this post). The following excerpt is about how to read a research paper:

```
Read with a question in mind. ""How can I use this?"" ""Does this really do what the author claims?"" ""What if...?"" 
```

The above, is what scientific temper is all about. It gives us the option of questioning everyone and everything. This has been drilled into me and other researchers by our respective research advisers - to never accept anything until you can prove it to yourself, until you can convince yourself of the validity of the idea presented in a research paper. No matter how successful/popular the author of the paper is, no matter how well cited a paper is, don't trust the presented results until you can prove it to yourself - either by deriving the proof yourself or by writing the code, doing the experiments and reproducing the results yourself.

A scientific temper teaches you to question everyone - from your parents, then your teachers, to your Governments. 

The reason this is not easy, is because it requires you to have an ego big enough to say ""everything is wrong until I verify it"" and simultaneously a humility big enough to say ""I was wrong"" when a mistake is pointed out. 

In the political scenario, you have Governments and followers indulging in fear-mongering to keep people in tow. You see fake videos spreading hatred and phobia that are easily debunked. You see Governments telling you that there are terror elements that intend to destroy the country - while a simple database lookup will show that on average, annually, less than 60 people die from cross-border terrorism of all kinds in India. 

Option 1, is to blindly believe anything your Government says. Option 2, is to put a lot of effort into investigating it yourself. 

Option 1 is about having faith, akin to following a religion. Its about clapping and lighting candles, while having blind faith that everything will be alright, no questions asked. Its about mindlessly chanting ""All is Well"" as portrayed in that (ironically) idiotic movie.
This option, leads to a faith based Governance - do nothing, have faith in us. 

Option 2 is about seeking the truth for yourself by exploration and collecting your own data samples. Its about being constantly updated and asking, rather nagging them, with questions like ""when will a mass testing program begin?"". 
This option, leads to people-driven Governance where we hold the decision-making power at every step of the way and the government only holds tools to execute those decisions.

More power to you, me, everyone.

If you are upset that there are some Indians who are ridiculing the thalis and diyas- I would like you to know that they are not against you, but are unhappy with the government and are against its glaringly divisive and cult practices. They are not against our culture but are against the political parties which are using it to divide our country.

And If you are someone who finds those thali bangers and diya lovers ridiculous - please remember that not every Indian is blessed with good fortune and privilege. For those of us who are not yet friends with science and the doctrine of individualism - faith, and a sense of belonging to a community still are their best friends. Yes, they seek hope and joy in such trivial acts. And I am sorry, but this is the country you are born into. Hate it or strive to make it better. The choice is yours. People are not the problem, corrupt politicians who prey upon them are.

Let’s learn to love and support each other despite the differences. Why?, Because Gandhi ji said so.

Are We Hypocrite Inherently?,13,AskIndia,LoneGuy1997,fvt6j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvt6j5/are_we_hypocrite_inherently/,8,1586181164.0,"Okay. So I see myself amidst a society where people live a double life. One life is the personal one, and the other they think they and everyone around is supposed to live (but the fact that they don't live it and are ignorant of it). I'll give you some examples of it. 
1) In between these ""QUARANTIMES"", we see people on social media arguing about who is wrong and who is right for every step that govt takes, and therefore they split people into two groups (National and Anti-national). Instead of thinking about the notion of a simple idea like torching lights, they fight over and make jokes about the people who won't do it and to the extent of bullying them. They act as if they care so much about the nation that they won't let that person become anti-nationalist, change his thinking and be a help for the country. Mind it, it's all happening on the social media, but in the real-life you'll see the same set of people breaking the rules, throwing away garbage here and there, when asked about justifying their these acts lead to a "" kya fark padta hai"" attitude. Do they do this just because they want to show other people?
2) I am a student at a premier institute. Most of my classmates live a double life when it comes to academics. When there is an argument over why our education system is not productive, each and everyone will start suggesting how the institute doesn't provide excellent teaching, and profs are boring, etc. But when it comes to them, they won't give any second thought about playing games in the class, bunking them, even indulge in cheating almost every time if they are left unattended.

On the one hand, people pretend that they have very profound knowledge about who is wrong and what is to be done for the betterment of society, but when it comes to them, they themselves are the very first one to break the rules.",2020-04-06 19:22:44

This divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites.

With the coronavirus further slowing down an already relatively slow economy and increasing an already high unemployment rate, such misinformation will definitely cause more riots (or worse, a civil war).

The ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor. During the Delhi riots, most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor. They will only further suffer if such misinformation that causes communal tensions are spread.

To the people who have read this post till now, if you see anybody in WhatsApp or any other social media site posting any misinformation or fake news, I implore you to call them out for spreading such misinformation and tell them that it is ILLEGAL AND PUNISHABLE if they further do so. Whether you are respectful to them or not is at your own discretion. If they still don't stop then report them to the concerned authority.

Those of us who feel this way should just stop participating in or even addressing these theatrics and as a bonus, plan and execute our own small scale activities. Activities which will keep the sheeple indoors, out of trouble and prevent them from spreading misinformation or anything. The fact that much of the country doesn't give a damn about what the PM or any other influential person or celebrity says should be enough to shut them up and make them focus solely on the pandemic. 
They don't know what it's like to see our neighbours, relatives and friends do dangerously stupid things during a crisis. They won't have to deal with the fallout. The media won't stop addressing this shit, the celebrities will keep spreading nonsensical things and other bad things will continue to happen. 
I think what we, as responsible and sane citizens, should do is this:

1) Just follow the WHO and govt guidelines regarding safety and health. 
2) Stop addressing anything the govt, the celebrities or any influencers say that doesn't focus on facts or logical steps regarding the covid-19 situation. Don't address any gestures or encouraging words from them. 
3) Come up with fun activities to engage yourselves and your neighbours to save them from participating in mindless behaviour. 

Even if small pockets of our population do this instead of submitting to whatever our leaders push on us, it'll be a victory. When we look back on this period of crisis, I don't want to see these influencers labelled as heroes and saviours. I don't want to see the glorification and rationalisation of these dumb acts. 

I want to see the stories of frontline soldiers and those few citizens who refused to be led into idiotic acts, who defied the system, who went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the survival our their community and their sanity. 
Our leaders don't represent us. We are smart and sophisticated. History should remember how the citizens were the ones who kept the nation alive and kicking.

FUCK Modi, fuck celebrities, fuck those irresponsible assholes who have willingly and in full awareness of their actions ensured the deaths of thousands.

"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",380,Policy/Economy,ringtring,fv9ifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,62,1586098195.0,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

Source: 15th Finance Commission Report 2020-21. Pages 34, 35, 55, 56, and 99. [Accessible here](https://fincomindia.nic.in/writereaddata/html_en_files/oldcommission_html/fincom15/XVFC_202021%20Report_English_Web.pdf), at the Finance Commission's website.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",2020-04-05 20:19:55

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

police, officials, media can’t see what i saw? and I am sure you can see this kind of sites in many other cities too! So tell me what is more important right now, to whip about something happened or take actions against what will going to happen!

Hate is more deadly, more infectious then corona, Love and hate are very subjective, you love somebody today might faces hate from you tomorrow or someone you hate today will be became beloved later! It’s depend on Image! positive or negative in your mind! and today Our politicians and media trying hard to implement negative image in to our minds! Mohammad Rafi, A.r.rahman, Abdul kalam, we all love them and also respect them today despite their religion, we have starting to hate whom we don’t know anything about, never met never seen! so where this hate came from? 
Right now one answer-bad Media and who are behind it! 

Love and hate do not follow any boundaries, when this Muslim propaganda is over it can jump on you too! If in the future for any reason you are not theirs favorable then you are the deshadrohi no matter which religion or cast you belongs, think my friends!

We can and we will create vaccine for corona but nobody else can ever make vaccine for Hate, if it catches you then there is no end, there is only you who can make vaccine within your self to protect against most contagious and most deadly virus “The Hate”.",2020-04-06 20:27:11

I don't know any place where I can buy sex toys in India.

Please try to answer this question without judging us. Me and my boyfriend are currently in need of some sex toys. We usually buy everything that we need on Amazon, but sex toys aren't available there. I recently bought a vibrator (it was called body massager) from Amazon and it was very bad. All other sex toys on Amazon look to be of cheap quality and I don't want to buy it from there. We want a website/store which sells sex toys exclusively. We would like to buy different toys like the rabbit ears vibrator, the prostate massager, and explore other different toys to use in bed. Is there any trusted website/store where we can buy sex toys? I looked up on Google and saw a few websites where the toys were very expensive but at the same time, the websites looked sketchy. I dont mind paying for all those sex toys, but I don't want to get cheated and lose my money. If I get the toys home, it'll be worth it. So please tell me any website/store you know where I can buy the toys that I want and won't have the fear of losing money. 

Additional information: we live in Bengaluru, so we would like a store/website which delivers to Bengaluru. Thank you.

Also, I'll order the toys only after the lockdown period is over. But I would like to know the websites right now so that I can explore and decide what to buy.",2020-04-06 18:33:25

How do I get my boyfriend's parents to give me a chance?,42,AskIndia,throwaway9055555,fvgj13,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvgj13/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriends_parents_to_give_me_a/,52,1586132930.0,"I hate being a white girl barging in during a global pandemic to talk about my own shit but if anyone wants to get their mind off of it with some sweet in-law drama, read on.

So we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

Switch to me. I'm very in love with him. We've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

Switch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I'm not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""I'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

What we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

I don't expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don't want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They're just gonna tell me I'm useless for however many minutes. 

Idk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.

But the fate was not on our side. He started coughing a little bit and had fever. We were still feeding him from feeding tube. Today his health was a little bit down so we decided to take him to the hospital and they screened all of us for Covid-19 due to the symptoms. Fortunately we all are negative. 

In the x-ray,it's showing that his left lung has collapsed completely. These last 2 months have really been awful for us especially for my mother as she isn't really coping well.

I have recently come to know that my college is going to convert my hostel to an isolation ward.

We hostel occupants are against this decision. They are breaking in our room by breaking our locks. Many of us have our precious belongings like documents and gadgets. They've said they will empty our rooms, collect our stuff and store it some polythene and store all that in some common area.  I took all my belongings with me except some of my documents (Mark-sheets etc) and I fear that they are going to get lost. Some of us have left much more like a whole desktop, laptops and other expensive things.

Our college officials can barely run a college properly and most of us reckon that this is going to end in a massive disaster where many of us loose our belongings.

All of this decision was taken without any prior notice. Not even a slightest hint. Most of were informed by word of mouth by our college mates.

I respect that our college is taking initiative and helping in this tough time but this isn't the way.

Some of the colleges got an order from DM to convert the hostel into an isolation ward but our college isn't required to convert hostel rooms into isolation ward because we didn't receive any notice.

Our janitors barely clean our toilets. And god knows how are they gonna sanitize the rooms after that mess.

Is there a way to stop this ?",2020-04-05 22:37:26

- what exactly are you doing with PM cares fund? What is the progress?
- what is your plan to provide sufficient PPE kits to medical staff and doctors? By when? 
- what is India's plan to develop cure for covid-19 and by when can we see any outcome?
- what's up with economy and how you plan to fix it as covid-19 is controlled?
- what is the update on scaling up testing of COVID-19 cases?
- China built hospitals within days. Have you done anything like that or alternative to quarantine people?

I know PM wouldn't have exact answers to above questions. It's tough time. But he can atleast provide an update on these more critical questions in his video, rather than just praising public and asking them to do stupid things. Honestly, even I could do that. 

Secondly, this PM has no guts to hold press conference. Even trump is answering to reporters. Then why PM Modi can't? Why he choose to hide and talk from behind the screen only?

That's why I have arrived at my plan to keep lights on and play Bella Ciao. I know the neighbors won't understand what's it and I am safe.

My grandmom, 85 years old, went to see her son (my uncle) in Dehradun in Jan from Bengaluru. She couldn't handle the cold and experiencing bloated hands, legs and body ache. At this age, its highly unlikely she can stay there and manage it. The cold can be more lethal or as equally as COVID for her. Because of COVID-19 lockdown there is no apparent way we can bring her back.

Her son is a doctor who is at frontline working for COVID-19. So he is quarantined; couldn't attend / take care even his mother at this time of need. So, bringing her back home seems to be a better solution.

I'm here requesting help in any idea that can solve her problem or help or bring her back to Bengaluru.",2020-04-06 07:15:16

Get ready for a huge surge of Muslimophobia and Hindu nationalism after/during this lockdown,19,Non-Political,Death1s1nevitable,fvdta1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvdta1/get_ready_for_a_huge_surge_of_muslimophobia_and/,7,1586122236.0,"I'll be straighforward: our country already has a lot of Muslimophobia (I am not gonna say Islamophobia because hating Islam as in ideology shouldn't be treated as a bad thing. Treating Muslims badly because you hate Islam, on the other hand, should be bad) and Hindu nationalism is evidently on the rise. Even though at first thought, it might seem that coronavirus may not affect the rate at which these two are growing, it is going to affect it in a huge way. 

The biggest blunder has to be the Tablighi Jamat. Out of 3000+ cases, 1000+ cases (more than 33% of the cases) has been linked to the Jamat. Among the rest, if you just see the initial list of dead people from corona, you will see a lot of them (if not most) had visited Saudi Arabia or other Muslim countries. As you might know, Muslims are already blamed for almost every historic and bad events. There is a huge chance that the entire coronavirus epidemic in India maybe said to be 'brought by Muslims to harm Hindus'. The number of fake news which tries to show that Muslims are deliberately trying to harm Hindus is already bad.

Unfortunately for Muslims, during this crisis when they were already being alienated by CAA-NRC, Jamat has been responsible for the steep rise in cases. Not that Hindus or other religions did not do something like that - Hindus got together in Vaishno Devi, they got together in many festivals, they got together during gaumutra party, they got together for 'thali bajaa'ing. But there has been no cases linked to any of those events. It might be that there are coronavirus carriers and cases among them, but since it isn't testable and observable, we cannot make any definite statement, it won't be scientific.

To make things worse, if we somehow get through this nightmarish pandemic, remember Modi will get all the credit. People will say that ""Modi handled the pandemic in India well"". This might even increase his approval rate among common people. Not to mention that if the apparent growth rate of cases in India remains slower than other countries, as it currently is, it might increase people's faith in the  superiority of India. People might say ""Look at those immoral westerners. They have been punished for their immoral lifestyle by karma. That is why India, such a holy land, hasn't been greatly affected by it apart from those Muslims and Chinese who brought that disease to India!"". This narrative might gain a lot of attention. Never underestimate the power of fake news, ethnonationalism, authoritarianism and racism.",2020-04-06 03:00:36

A lot of people generally just want to stick to their culture and principles, which their religion & patriotism gives them, but they are being misled by the Hindutva brigade, that you need to be intolerant if you want to be a good Hindu or a good patriot for that matter.

Seeing the [growth trajectory of the confirmed cases country by country](https://i.imgur.com/noXGCYY.png), it can be seen that India is still on an upward trajectory AND has not yet reached the peak, one essential thing that shows the slowing down of infection in a country. With other countries, you can see they've started to curve in the graph. So the worst is still yet to come, and we won't know how much the rate of infection has been until testing capacity is increased multifold. The infection spread rate however have slowed because of the lockdown.

The country needs to be prepared with the worst that is yet to come, with PPE, Ventilators and all other necessary equipment.

Insider's Account: Covid-19 Triage Facility at IGI, Delhi Airport

Hello,

I landed in India on March 21 at 0800 hours at IGIA T3: Indira Gandhi International Airport Terminal 3, New Delhi - India, just a few hours before the ban on international flights ordered by the Government of India came into being.

I am ex-Prime Minister's Fellow (RD) and through this post, I am sharing my first-hand experience about arrival, covid-19 testing facility and everything in between, for whatever that's worth.

I hope my account will help you get a glimpse of what's ""really"" happening on ground. And how much are we really prepared as a country to deal with the pandemic. I have divided this post into 4 short sections as per the four stages of testing process followed at IGI, Delhi, as I understood it. Kindly note that I did not hear any government official or medical/security staff using these terms for different testing stages. I have used them for organising my thoughts.

**Stage Alpha: MIXING-1 (Arrivals & Immigrations)**

I arrived via Ethiopian Airlines flight ET686 at 8:00 am on March 21. As I entered the airport building, I saw the first screening checkpoint with 3 doctors waiting for us. Since I was the first in the queue, a lady doctor moved a handheld device in front of my forehead and took my body temperature. I, then handed over my pre-filled Covid-19 medical form to her which the airline staff gave us before landing.

Her fellow doctor asked me which country I came from? I answered ""Ethiopia"". He looked puzzled and had no clue where the country was (and that's fine - he was a doctor not a quizmaster, so I didn't expect him to know)? So, I told him it is in East Africa. Surprisingly, this being the very first screening point, he did not have a checklist of high-risk countries (Iran/ Italy/Spain/China/etc.) so that he could check and categorise me as a ""high-risk"" or a ""low-risk"" passenger. The lady doctor recommended him to call one of the senior doctors at testing facility and get further instructions on how to categorise passengers arriving from Ethiopia. He did not have his mobile with him so he asked the lady doctor to call. She did not have talk-time balance to make a call!

What they did next left me shell shocked!!!

Male doctor said *"" Arre phone nahi mil raha toh choddo, jaane do sabko"" [ ""If we can't connect (to sr. doctors), leave it. Let everyone go""]*

And my medical form was stamped ""Quarantined at Home"" without asking about my travel history or medical condition. Most of the 300 passengers behind me got the same stamping on their medical forms and we were directed to the Immigrations.

At Immigrations counter, roughly 400-500 passengers from early morning flights were either sitting on the floor or swarmed around the counters - some with masks, some without them. These were passengers who came from all over the world with travel history that apparently included visits to Dubai, Iran, Italy, China, Japan, South Africa, Spain, Russia, the US etc.

I call this MIXING-1 stage, so at:

MIXING-1: Apparently, infected and uninfected people were made to sit together at less than arm's length from each other in a partially closed hall WITHOUT SEGREGATION - by country, medical history, or age. Masked people sat with unmasked one, young people sat next to old people, pregnant women sat next to unmasked women taking maternity tips, mid-age uncles shook hands over political gossips, teenage kids sneezed without tissues and got back to their smartphones, and many coughed out in that same open space.

And these 700-800 people were made to sit in front of Immigrations counter for 4 hours before moving them to the next stage.

>>Refer: Photograph 1, 2 & 3

**Stage Beta: MIXING-2 (Post-Immigration)**

Post Immigrations, we joined a group of another 200 people who had cleared immigrations before us and were waiting to move to the next stage. So, we became a larger group of 1000+ people. At this stage, we were randomly divided into smaller groups of 10 people.

I call this stage MIXING-2 at which 1000 people with all sorts of travel and medical history and widely different demographic characters were segregated into 100 smaller groups of 10 people and were taken to the next hall. Since 10 people in each group were randomly selected out of 1000, this was the second level of mixing that was done. My group of 10 had five 60+ passengers - two Indians who came from Serbia, and a couple who came from Melbourne.

Those 100 groups of 10-member each were given numbers from 1 to 100 and then made to sit next to each other at less than an arm’s length for another 3 hours in the same hall.

>>Refer: Photograph 4

**Stage Gamma: MIXING-3 (pre-testing)**

Now, it was time to move to the next stage in the process. A team of a senior bureaucrat, a medical supervisor, and a police/security supervisor began calling three 10-member groups at a time and instructed all 30 people to stand in a queue at less than arm's distance from each other - some wearing masks, some without masks, some coughing, some sneezing, some even eating a banana or a cupcake.

Those 40+ randomly mixed groups of 30-member each were taken to the baggage belts sequentially one after the other. Luggage was already unloaded by airlines staff off the conveyor belts. So, it was literally a sea of baggage pieces lying all over the place from Belt #1 to Belt #10. As passengers began collecting their respective luggage, each touched at least 5-10 different baggage pieces before he/she could identify his/her own - and some had their gloves on, while majority did not. And some had sneezed or coughed into their bare hands earlier! Once everyone collected their luggage, each group was assigned a police officer whose sole responsibility was to take his/her group of 30 to the testing facility, set-up outside the IGI next to the Uber/Ola pickup point. By now it was 7 pm and my group was waiting for its turn to be called at the testing facility.

Note that since my arrival at 8:00 am to the time when I claimed my baggage around 7:00 pm, it was already 11 hours without food, rest or sleep. And till this point no official testing or consultation with a doctor took place. However, 1000 passengers - infected and uninfected - were randomly mixed in smaller and bigger groups at least THREE TIMES by then!!

>> Refer: Photograph 5 & 6

**Stage Charlie: O.K. TESTED (testing)**

Finally, at 8:00pm, 12 hours since I landed and checked in at the airport, my group was called to the testing facility along with two other groups. We all walked in with our luggage. As I entered, I read on the sign board ""COVID-19 TRIAGE FACILITY"". The facility had two rooms - one waiting room as you entered, and one testing room beside it with an exit from the facility. So, at a time, members of one group went into the testing room with their luggage while those of other two groups waited in the first room.

When I entered the testing room along with 29 members of my group, I saw 30 doctors in their quarantine clothing, wrapped head-to-toe in white suits, head caps, and transparent eye-gears. By now, we all expected doctors to ask questions about our travel history, our recent medical condition, and run some sort of blood and nasal swab tests. Right!!?

Well, we were all wrong!

As I sat in front of my doctor, she handed over a pamphlet. It had Covid-19 symptoms explained in Hindi and English on either side of it. She then asked me to read it and ask any questions or doubt I had! Though I did not see any medical devices, syringes, or nasal swab kits anywhere in the testing room, I was still hoping that may be the doctors would do it on case to case basis post-consultation.

My doctor asked me: *“Do you have any corona virus symptoms?*
I answered with a *“No”*, expecting a few more probing questions about my health history, recent condition, etc.

To my utter shock, she picked up a rubber stamp, and stamped me with a

**Proud to Protect**
**Delhiites**
**HOME QUARANTINED**
**till**
**21 April**

Below are some of the questions and the ONLY QUESTIONS that my group members were asked before they were stamped “Home Quarantined”, without any blood, swab or other Covid-19 tests:

*“Did you take a bath today?”*
*“Do you take bath every day”?*
*“Are you on any kind of medication?”*
*“Do you smoke?”*

I left the Covid-19 Triage facility around 9:45 pm, roughly 14 hours after I landed in the morning. Many of my group members took connecting flights to Ranchi, Cochin, Bangalore, Mumbai, Lucknow, etc.

>>Refer: Photograph 7 & 8

In a nutshell, this is what happened in those 14 hours as per the plan which was put in place:

1. Around 1000 people were checked-in at the airport without segregation as per their travel or medical history.
2. Those 1000 people were grouped three to four times into batches of different sizes and demographic composition.
3. Same 1000 people were repeatedly made to sit with each other in the same space in close proximity for long hours.
4. Finally, most of those 1000 people after apparently infecting each other in the last 10-15 hours were stamped “home quarantined” at a “Covid-19 Triage Facility” without running any medical tests.
5. All cleared patients left the testing facility and would have mingled with the larger population in different parts of India on their way to their homes.

This all happened,

- while the rest of India was implementing “Junta Curfew” and Bollywood celebrities were clapping or banging thalis from their balconies,

- while NRIs were gloating with pride over India’s stupendous success at keeping Covid-19 spread under control,

- while uncles were explaining how government’s step will help “break the chain”,

- while aunties were experimenting with turmeric and neem-patta recipes to cure corona virus,

and

**- while the media were busy running COVID-19 talk shows instead of reporting on the most vulnerable ENTRY and EXIT points in the country - our airports!**

**Special Thanks**

I am grateful to the frontline health workers, doctors, airport ground staff, CISF and police personnel and all the volunteers who discharged their duty selflessly, putting themselves at a great risk every single day, to help passengers complete the screening and testing process end-to-end. I have nothing but huge respect and loads of love for them.

**They were just following orders!**

P.s. By the time I left the airport, it was already 10 pm and given the corona virus situation in Delhi, I did not want to put my friends at risk. So, I chose to stay in a hotel for a night and then leave for home next morning.

I booked a room at **Lemon Tree Hotels** (Red Fox Hotel Delhi Airport, Hotel, Asset No.6, Aerocity Hospitality District, IGIAirport) for a night through a friend and reached there by 10:20 pm. The ground staff checked-in my luggage through security scan as I walked in towards reception. The lady there took my passport as ID and asked for my travel history.

I told her that I flew from Ethiopia and have been checked by doctors at IGI Airport for my symptoms and none existed. She asked me for a medical certificate so I showed her the stamp on my hand from the Covid-19 Triage facility. She seemed indecisive and requested that their home doctor would do my checkup. I readily agreed and waited for a few minutes. Soon the hotel manager (Prateek Shukla - not fully sure about his name) intervened and told me that they can't take me in. I reminded him about Delhi Government's order that gave people self-quarantine option at private hotels. I also mentioned the notice on their website (see photograph 9) that had no such information about denying entry into the hotel based on Covid-19 suspicion. In fact the notice's language seemed inclusive and empathetic. Despite all my efforts to reason with the manager, I was denied entry into the hotel that I had pre-booked.

By now it was 11:00 pm. I asked the hotel transport staff to take me to any other hotel in Aerocity, but was told that all hotels have internally adopted the same policy and no one would let me in. Given the ""Junta Curfew"" , my options were few (if any). I took a call to pick the first bus I would get and leave for home. I reached home at 4 am today, after 14 hours of mental torture at IGI, 2 hours of arguing with some hotel staff to let me in, and 4 hours of road journey - feeling scared, helpless, and angry.

Our Government is a master in distracting people from the tel question, is this the same. As I see people celebrating this moment and not asking about the real question here why are we doing this? I asked my family members and some friends they all said it’s a Mini Diwali. Today lord Ram killed the Meghanath so we all are celebrating. 

Well that’s funny isn’t it? In my personal opinion this moment is just used to distract people coz in recent 3 to 4 days the daily new COVOD19 cases are more than 500+. And reports are emerging from across the India that doctors don’t have enough PPE they are not being treated well by the officials and the people they are treating. Some media houses is saying that government is not providing reliable data on the no of cases and the measures taken by them to tackle Coronavirus. Also the reason behind the new fund PM Cares is also not clear as the PM relief fund already has more than 3,400+ Cr. Rupees. And how government is using the money from PM Cares. These are just small questions which we really do need to ask from the government and they don’t want to answer that. 

So,  we really need to ask is that is this was really necessary or it’s just a new propaganda by government to hide its tracks like previous many. 
I’m not saying this is bad or you shouldn’t do it I’m saying we really need to focus on the real problem which is coronavirus in this case. Celebrate and ask.

Given the communal narrative being spread against them, this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime.

He then asked the other Jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same ""treatment"". Any guesses how many would willingly come forward now?

In most other parts of India, so far the administration [has made efforts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/those-revealing-identity-of-covid-19-patients-to-face-action/articleshow/74590731.cms) to preserve patients anonymity, but I guess these rules can be bent if there are ""special circumstances"".

Yes, you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them, but that can be easily achieved by using [hand stamps](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/privacy-fears-india-hand-stamps-suspected-coronavirus-cases-200320120033460.html) or [""Home Under Quarantine"" stickers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-covid-19-stickers-being-stamped-on-houses-of-home-quarantined-families-1660543-2020-03-28), though IMO even these methods should be employed only on willful violators. But at least with these methods, only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire city/nation and any potential backlash will be minimized.

Charging people with the draconian National Security Act (which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year) is also counterproductive, while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers, ordinary Muslims in UP, who are already deeply distrustful of the Yogi government, will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers. 

Similarly, by now we have all heard of [how 5000 migrant workers were sprayed with bleach](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/india/india-migrant-workers-sprayed-intl/index.html) to ""disninfect"" them.

There is a simple way by which we can help in this cause while being at home.   
On twitter lots of people asking for help but they are not tagging right authorities who can help. **This is where we can help**. Tag all the tweets where someone is looking for help, with a common tag pattern:

  
**#corona\_help\_cityname**  
e.g. #corona\_help\_mumbai  
In this way, all the asks for a city are aggregated under one common hashtag and can be easily discovered by government authorities and others who are helping people.

Amazon.in forcing users to setup UPI in order to donate to PMCARES and other NGOs,13,Non-Political,tfwalpha,fvbpzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvbpzh/amazonin_forcing_users_to_setup_upi_in_order_to/,5,1586111152.0,"Amazon.in is running this donation campaign where they are asking customers on their platform to donate to PMCARES fund and other NGOs like Akshay Patra, Oxfam, etc which is a good thing. However, there is no option to pay via Amazon Wallet or Cards or Net Banking. One needs to signup to UPI and set it up with Amazon in order to donate through them. I believe it is a cheap marketing strategy which should have been avoided at this moment. Many people like me who do not use UPI because they simply don't want another banking service are frustrated with push campaigns already and this donation thing just triggered me to the point where I felt the need to post about it here. I quickly checked that Paytm is also accepting donations for PMCARES and they have no such strict rule to accepting money. There are obviously other means but this kind of marketing tactics from Amazon is unacceptable and needs to be highlighted.

Must Read : The plight of the Indian Farmer,30,Non-Political,swindlerchomp,fv88qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv88qa/must_read_the_plight_of_the_indian_farmer/,2,1586091536.0,"A few hundred miles from South Asia's glamour capital: Mumbai, a new day is marked by the lifeless body of another Indian farmer dangling from a peepul tree by a noose. More than 200,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last decade in Maharashtra's Vidarbha alone, an area the size of Portugal in central India. However, being an admirer of only the beautiful, the middle class Indian and their news, is carefully sanitized of any mention about these starving, sun-burnt wretches that cannot even afford the diet provided to one commercial European cow. The Indian farmer is invisible in life and in death. Thus, while his ripe, turgid oranges reach the gentleman's table, this abomination of a human being vanishes into obscurity, thrashed and ravaged by a burden of debt as the content hungry Indian media looks at the shopping malls and celebrity gossip to fill their pages.

I do not intend to ruin the appetite of my fine, educated compatriots on this forum, by whining the demise of a two penny cotton, orange farmer from India, I am here to enlighten you all on the ways of making these useless deaths profitable: the Monsanto way!

In the 1990s, Monsanto, ventured into India with its variety of genetically modified cotton seeds: BT cotton. In this introductory episode, I would skip the illegalities of Monsanto's field trials in India for which the Indian supreme court suspended Monsanto's Indian trading rights until 2001.

Fast forward to 2002: Monsanto's agents start approaching Vidarbha's farmers about these BT cotton seeds (later known as suicide seeds). The seeds were expensive, but Monsanto had already arranged with Indian banks for huge loan provisions to farmers who agreed. The farmers were promised unimaginable profits from these super-seeds, mostly verbally. Most importantly, Monsanto's agents were nice, personable and they actually addressed the Indian farmers as if they were human beings. When you are nice to the poor, you take away their bargaining power. Unable to read or write, these gullible, uneducated farmers put their thumb-print (in lieu of their signature) on Monsanto's agreement and approached banks for loans several times their annual revenue. The loans were all approved without any hurdle. The farmer was literally on a joyride, for the first time in several generations.

In the eyes of the erudite, this was a picture perfect move. In one sweep, millions of dollars of public money lying in the local banks became Monsanto's money, riding on shoulders of half-naked cotton farmers of Vidarbha.

Then reality struck: the crops failed, they failed miserably. When the farmers approached the same agents for answers, the attitude was different from last time. The agents pointed the illiterate farmer, who is unable to even sign his name, to a clause built into page x, line y of the initial document. The clause redeemed Monsanto of failed harvest unless the farmer had also bought Monsanto's very expensive fertilizer and pesticide as well. The news broke as hellfire on the destitute farmer that was already on the brink of devastation from three failed cotton harvests. There was no way for the farmer to afford these expensive fertilizers and pesticides.

Obviously, when the farmers approached the banks and local politicians on Monsanto's payroll, both referenced the same documents with the thumb print of the farmers and held the farmer alone responsible for their debt.

If you have decided to read on, let me warn you that there is no silver lining.

Until now, after each harvest, the farmers would save their indigenous seeds in local seed banks, but they have not sown indigenous for past several harvest cycles. So the older variety of indigenous seeds that the farmer sowed, are no longer to be found and worse still: Monsanto has bought over all the local seed banks. 99% of cotton exported by India is BT cotton, the indigenous varieties are all but extinct. These were the same indigenous cotton varieties that once clad Alexander’s army, the ancient Romans and the Egyptian Pharaohs. The native Indian cotton that led Europe into a global exploration for trade routes and set forth the age of explorations - is all but gone.

At this point, the Vidarbha farmers give up the fight, decide to swallow their loss and make the best of what they have. In the absence of indigenous seeds, they moved to sow the seeds from the previous Monsanto harvest. However, the friendly Monsanto agent came knocking back. The agent pointed again to another clause in the agreement that declares Monsanto's patent on the seeds and prohibits the farmers from re-sowing them. The farmer is flabbergasted, never before had they known that seeds can be patented. Farmer lobby groups took Monsanto to court. Obviously Monsanto prevailed.

Monsanto's victory over the naked starving Indian farmers was hugely celebrated in various disguise. Our very own Nature called it a ""boost for research"". 

The patriotic, nationalistic Modi government refuses to talk about farmer suicides. For several years, it refused to publish the suicide numbers. In Nov 2018 when a huge rally of Indian farmers marched to Delhi begging for their justice and relief, they were flogged and shot at by the Indian police, and not one mainstream Indian media covered the story.

The memoirs of Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India 1773-85, describes the Indian famine caused by atrocious policies of another multinational corporation: The British East India Trading Company (EIC). Starving farmers would come to the city in the vain hope of finding leftovers discarded by the opulent employees of EIC. Starving and diseased, the Indian farmers are an ungainly sight for three centuries now. As the British sepoy would kick these wretched souls lining the street side, the farmer would cry out in agony: ""Baba!, baba!"": ""father, father"","" your countrymen have brought me to such misery, if it pleases you, I want to breath my last in your presence"". Like yesterday, the common people is just as engrossed in fighting each other and rioting, to be able to see the real evil plaguing them. India may have gained its own flag, but it is far from being independent.",2020-04-05 18:28:56

There are a couple of things I like here, namely the cheap economy, cheap rent, great housing in newly constructed apartments, great infrastructure with water, gas and electricity.

I'm from a top-tier engineering college and have a decent pay.

Looking for a change in job around start of 2021, and colleagues recommended Bangalore just because it has a lot more opportunities (in the category I'd be looking for) and should be my choice above NCR. Some of them have already been there and mostly came here for their families and advice me so.

Here's what I pay for in Noida -

Rent for 3 BHK (larger living area) - 18000, 6 kms from office, takes 20 minutes to reach in \~150 rupee split among two people per side for uber. Electricity is cheap. Gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes.

What's the equivalent for Bangalore?

Drawbacks - too few companies to apply for.

Fact is this makes me privileged. Talking about how we should have lockdowns intermittently for the sake of the environment is a privileged thought. 

Think of it this way, when it's a Sunday afternoon and there are heavy showers, it cancels alot of your plans and it's an inconvenience but who doesn't love looking at the rain right? That same rain is probably destroying someone's chance to earn their daily wage or accumulating so much water their house may be destroyed.

The home isolation has caught up to me and I'm wondering what it's like for people in India who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years. Is the phenomena of hikikomori different in India? I know many in our country are unemployed. Where do such people live? Are they truly socially reclusive? How do people make ends meet in such a dire situation? How do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society? What can people do to identify such behaviors? What triggered it for you? Is there a way to curb such triggers? 

If you do relate to this phenomenon please don't shy away and open up about what you feel. Indians suffer a lot of developmental problems when growing up. Some people are high functioning despite their inherent problem which often snowballs into something big, it's only a matter of time. Bullying and peer pressure play a huge role in our society and affects our personal decisions. How do we mitigate all of this?

I'd love to engage with you guys over here for now and have a better understanding of your expectations and needs. To whoever that participates on this thread: please be civil and respectful. God knows how much people have already suffered.",2020-04-05 22:27:48

He and other volunteers with him are risking their lives to feed thousands of poor people. They are stepping up where the government is failing it's citizens, they are risking infection when we are sitting at home as if it's a vacation. 

A few days ago the solicitor general of India put up fake and baseless allegations against Harsh Mander,the allegations were that Mr Maser had made derogatory comments that brought disrepute to the Supreme Court , the chief justice did not even hear to Harsh Mander's Lawyer and scolded Harsh Mander for bringing disrepute to the Supreme Court, they scolded him without even reading his speech and just based on what the solicitor general said. These allegations against Mr Mander was made after he made complaints of hate speeches during the Delhi Riots.

Excerpts from the hearing:
the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said: “If this is what you feel about the Court, then we will have to decide what to do about you.” He also decided to defer a hate speech petition presented by Mander. “Till we sort this out we will not hear you but will hear others.”

Mander’s lawyer, Dushyant Dave, pleaded with the judges: “Please go through the entire speech … the filing of the application by Delhi Police against Mander is an attempt to browbeat him … He is being put in the dock for nothing.” But, again, the Court did not hear the full speech. It continued to rely on the Solicitor General’s version now, presumably, supported by the police. And it ordered Mander to respond to the allegations and fixed an April date for the next hearing.

I request Indians to please write an email to both the solicitor general and the Chief Justice of India. The email should be polite courteous and should have 100% accuracy of facts. Please write in the email that Mr Mander has been doing great service to the nation and such treatment of him is not appreciated by the citizens. Please humbly, politely and respectfult remind both the Solicitor General and the Chief Justice, that the world is an uncertain place and that governments fall and rise in an instant, this government too shall change one day. The government may change but the citizens will remain the same, and the citizens shall remember the conduct of the members of the legal system and that you fear that a lunatic like the one who showed Mr Adnan Goswami his place, may someday also remind the members of the legal system about their good and bad deeds, and that the citizens of India shall remember the good and bad deeds long after this government has changed. Please send them a email together so that they both know that the email was sent to them together. Send it en masse so they won't be able to single out anybody. If you are concerned about your privacy use a VPN and an anonymous email system found online. Please don't let your message be rude, vulgar or violent. The message should be kind, courteous and respectful.",2020-04-05 08:00:56

This is my first job and i have no prior experience in HR. Just need some advise for how to go about sourcing more profiles and dealing with possible candidates more effectively.  


What I've learned in my recent time here is the basic looking up profiles by searching , mass mailing, Job posting, etc. I have access to naukri and monster portals. Currently it mostly just involves dealing with passive candidates, and only getting a few interested here and there via calling. How can i make an effort to get more active candidates and more relevant ones?  


Also dealing with people in remote or rural areas, where people don't have good communication skills in English, or even in Hindi (south India, etc). Such areas also have a scarce amount of profiles on job portals or applicants. What would be the ways to get profiles of interested job seekers in such areas.  


The main issue is the setup daily profile targets, which let me say i don't have any problem with , but the fact that others (""experienced people"")  for some reason like to send irrelevant profiles or one that anyone will reject, while i try for more quality profiles and am more interested in resolving the recruitment process without anyone having trouble and the whole thing being beneficial to the candidate. (I know, what a pipe dream!. Not the way thing works and what not.)  
Also the fact that i am a fresher and am not efficient currently.  


TL;DR - Am a newb, and need advise how to source more profiles, more efficiently. Also recommend me references or articles about hr and related things so i can learn more. Thanks :)",2020-04-06 02:25:48

https://preview.redd.it/zy87u6z1uqq41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b456dedb4224dca0f38034a8c4be6011624aaf

### Tl;dr

We wrote to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to ensure reform of India’s internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. 

### Background

On 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India’s internet shutdown framework.  The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.

The government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   


### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications

We first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*

Noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   


### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs

We also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. 

We recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.

Looking information about a caste or tribe ‘Changar’,4,AskIndia,ConjureFromObscurity,fv89dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv89dt/looking_information_about_a_caste_or_tribe_changar/,0,1586091620.0,"Hello

The Changar tribe can be found in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia but they speak a language related to Rajasthani Marwari, Braj or Haryanvi. 

They must have migrated from North India to Punjab and then to Peshawar and Afghanistan and beyond. Along the way other low-status communities joined with them, some speaking Punjabi but assimilated together for socio-cultural regions. 

According to Wikipedia, “In India, The Changar are largely a landless community, with a few still involved in their traditionally occupation of lime manufacture. Most are now daily wage labourers. Like other Rajasthani Muslims, the community has a caste association or biradari panchayat, which resolves intra community disputes and enforces communal norms. Although the Changar live in close proximity to other such Muslim castes such as the Hiranbaz, Sindhi-Sipahi and Qaimkhani, intermarriages between them and the Changar are extremely rare. The Changar are Sunni Muslims, and their customs are similar to other Rajasthani Muslims. They have been granted Other Backward Class status, which makes them subject to a number of affirmative actions policies of the Government of India”

This part I believe is true: According to their traditions, the Changar left Rajasthan, with their initial settlement being in the districts of Bikaner, Churu and Nagaur. From there the Changars migrated to Sindh. A further migration then took place to Punjab, where many are still found. They speak Marwari among themselves, and Urdu with outsiders. 

However it is dubious to claim that many of them migrated to Persia in the Sasanian Empire, from there to Sasanian Egypt to Byzantine Empire, where there descendant's became known today as the Romani people in Turkey, who live mainly in East Thrace.[1]

>These are the same folks who may not even have helped their neighbours or maids in need but they want you to distribute money to the needy equally, without lapses. overnight.

*“We have been warned by WHO, opposition leader, and so many experts that Coronavirus will be a be a big challenge in the coming days and we must prepare for the same. But apparently, conducting an event with lakhs of people to welcome trump, eating lithi choka, Delhi election, and pogrom and toppling MP government was the biggest priority”.*

>Some of them cant even manage their home budget with a huge salary but they want you to manage the economy in these testing times without failures.

*“Again, don’t act like it has happened all of sudden, we had first CoVID-19 positive case in last week of January.”*

>Some of them can't attend their offices or meetings on time and some may not even wake up on time despite alarm clocks but they want you to announce the lockdown in the morning to give them time to hoard and stash the essentials.

*“Now I feel stupid to answer your idiotic statements.”*

>As if and announcement in the morning will have a different impact, silly!

>Their walls are filled with posts on migrants' sufferings but never a single post on what could be the solution to save lives without collateral damage.

>Their walls shamelessly avoid showing Sikhs doing langar, Muslims opening up their hotels to feed the needy, Christians opening their hearts to not just humans but also the suffering dogs on the roads, common men opening kitchens, ordinary people working with government employees to distribute money, goods, food. Don't be surprised why. They don't like you.

>They don't like you because for them you are part of a political party and ideology which they admonish and the fact that you won the a majority in Indian elections twice, which they have neither the capacity nor the maturity to digest.

>Alas, if, and only if, for one moment they could treat you as the head of the nation, head of their nation, the Prime Minister of India... but still, they don't like you.

*“Please go and check his attendance in parliament. And forget that, just check for how many days he was in India in last 6 years.”*

>You don't boast of your government's humongous efforts to be the first one to bring in thousands of Indians back home without even thinking for a second about their race, religion, language, orientation, or even citizenship.

>Your government will still serve them all and protect them all, just as any other citizen of India, but they still won't like you.

*“Isn’t this what they were elected for in the first place? The only thing Modi and his government have done so far to make us all feel that he’s the ringmaster.

*“Once again, we are really interested in finding out what is his master plan. Other than asking peple to bang thaali and burn diya.”*

>The goal is not to win but to just hang in there and live another day till the virus is defeated by the scientists, people, doctors or the very nature that brought it up.

*“By sitting at home? Not increasing the number of testing, asking people for team building activities? We are not children that need to be entertained every other week with his gimmicks. We want to know what are his plans to save the MSME sector which is literally the backbone of our GDP.”*

So this happened with my food delivery,29,Food,chaha-pohe,fuw9ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuw9ha/so_this_happened_with_my_food_delivery/,12,1586045402.0,"Today I ordered some food from swiggy. Order status was showing Delivery executive collected food and is on the way but from tracking his bike was showing off the route and it got delayed by 10-15 min so I called executive and he said he is on the way and will meet me in 2 min my apartment gate. I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion. 

What do you think of it guys ?

TLDR : Order got delivered late, I suspect food was taken away, No confirmation of order deliverey, had to cancel myself despite receiving package. Got refund but feel something is fishy.",2020-04-05 05:40:02

Opinion: What's the point of being religious if it doesn't rid you of basic human vices?,155,Non-Political,Sulh-i-kul,funn5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/funn5p/opinion_whats_the_point_of_being_religious_if_it/,45,1586004733.0,"One of my neighbours and their family are super religious. They conduct loud Pujas during Navratra, twice a day. They conduct havans, Jaaps, Jagrata et al regularly, sometime even multiple times a month. Our family does that too, but not as often or at the same scale as them. 

When they're not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, I can hear them yell at each other - ALL DAY LONG. They call each other names to the extent that'd make a road rag blush. Nobody in our building, therefore, likes them one bit - they're a nuisance not only to each other, but to other families in the building too, many of whom have impressionable little children.

This made me think - What's the point of following any religion if it doesn't bring you an iota of peace or doesn't rid you of basic vices of jealousy, intolerance, harm to the fellow human, and lack of empathy in general? What would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day?

And finally, how can Indian religions be reformed to make better humans out of us?",2020-04-04 18:22:13

We would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (PART RANT),83,Business/Finance,abbawaddadu,fupeo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fupeo0/we_would_have_gone_into_a_recession_regardless_of/,21,1586014075.0,"People seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",2020-04-04 20:57:55

A little bit about me ever since I was 9yrs old I have been a fan of animation ( anime in particular ) and through various trials in my life from not been able to draw a simple circle to convince my parents to let me choose animation as my career path I have come a long way (I mean for me atleast) 

I don't know how to explain this feeling but for the past couple of days (7-10maybe) I have been very down , depressed , my heart aches daily like there's a hand grabbing my heart pressing it what not and I have even cried a lot before going to sleep ( silently although I wanted to shout at the top of my head but couldn't as it would wake my parents ) 

What I am trying to say maybe is that I am currently feeling as if I don't know anything about animation be it 2d or 3d ..everyday I keep on practicing and learning and try to do my best but it never feels enough and I am worried sick what will I do after I graduate ( I am in my 2nd year if college ) 

The thing is I am self taught because I failed my NID and DUFA exam mainly because I have been practicing art digitally since I was in 9-10th standard or so and the exams where in traditional medium my dad asked if I wanted to go for a private uni for arts but I declined the offer because I was told by a couple of people and professional that it's pretty much useless and I chose one of the easiest course in DU in the hopes that I will have a lot of free time to teach myself and spare money to buy equipment if necessary (my fee is only 27000 for 3years)  both of these things came true I do have a a lot of time and my fee is not much .

I knew this was a risky move getting into a course that's not related to animation ( it is, if u thing of it as a business because I do want to have my own studio and it does kinda help ) and I believed a lot in myself that I will do good but apparently I haven't ! As much as I want to tell my parents that I am scared as to what I would do in the future, I just can't because it won't help me and would only stress them because they will start worrying and it's not like they know anything about animation and would start making calls for knowledge and help ..I don't want to give them that kind of a stress right now .

I should also mention this I do plan to do a 6 month diploma on animation and fine arts after I graduate respectively 

The reason I made this post is because I wanted to let go of this feeling JUST LET ME OUT. And get a good couple of advice from people who are in the Animation industry as to how it works and stuff and get in touch with them , get some advice from people to resolve this feeling and most importantly to find myself a mentor who couple give me tasks to do this and that either weekly or monthly and later review my works and broadly point my mistakes and give me some direction 

All the hard-work would come from me but I need someone to guide me ! YouTube videos would never point out my mistake and I need someone to I guess

I will link my best works at the end.

I have figured I work best when someone gives me deadline to work with. I just need someone to tell me who actually has knowledge to from either school or industry to give me assignment and nothing more I will find what that things means etc etc and just review my work at the end .

I beg you if you thing you have that kind of knowledge and can spare 30-40min a week or a month please help this stranger ( I told my name in the beginning because I believe one stops thing of you as a complete stranger if they know your name ) 

You don't even have to give me your phone number or email address we can talk directly on Reddit message or Instagram or Facebook or any other app that you might thing is comfortable ( in case this message looks like a scam) 

But I beg you if you can spare a couple of minutes a week or a month to help me please do although I don't have anything to give in return but I would be ever grateful for your help.

PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU CAN.

How bout quad-nation aircraft carrier for IOC,13,Science/Technology,ReadwithKartikeya,fuv5y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuv5y8/how_bout_quadnation_aircraft_carrier_for_ioc/,7,1586041454.0,"# How bout a Quad-nation Aircraft Carrier Strike Group?

***By: Kartikeya Semwal***

With the ever-increasing threat posed by China’s PLA Navy in the IOC (Indian Ocean Region), neighbouring countries like Japan, South Korea and Australia have started feeling the need to induct and operate aircraft carriers of their own. Till now, none of these countries has an operational Aircraft Carrier (AC). Instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or ALS (Amphibious Landing Ships).

[INS Vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)

But more than them, India feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 Aircraft Carriers (ACs). Currently, Indian Navy has a solo AC called INS Vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from Russia. By 2022, India will get its 2nd AC which is its own indigenous AC called INS Vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. Now since India has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 AC fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. 

[India's Indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)

Guarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe Pakistan doesn’t have an AC of its own. Opposite to that, China currently has 2 ACs namely Laoning & Shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. With this, China’s power projection through it’s PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India. China is working on getting 2 more ACs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of IOC. Till date, IOC has been guarded by India Navy in coordination with Japanese & South Korean Navy. 

[PLA Navy AC Shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)

Indian Navy’s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of PLA Navy & to effectively guard the IOC region, it needs a 3rd AC which if accepted by Govt. of India (GOI); will be India’s 2nd indigenous AC called INS Vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. Due to this reason, GOI is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd AC for Indian Navy.

[India-Australia Navy Officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)

But there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an AC jointly by 4 nations namely India, Australia, Japan & South Korea. Indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. This will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. I am hereby sharing the following points about it:-It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

1. Having a joint AC will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. 

2. It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

3. Each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as Japan for its electrical & electronic parts, Australia and South Korea for their weapon packages & crew and India for its expertise in hull & designing. 

4. Since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best AC built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. 

5. A huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. 

6. Joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 South Asian countries. That will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. 

7. Automatic threat-neutralisation from China’s PLA Navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint AC as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. 

  

[F-35 B taking off from US Aircraft Carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)

One point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. Now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as Lockheed Martin’s F-35Bs or the 4+ generation Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Now except India, all 3 countries have already ordered F-35As for their airforce’ modernization plans. So they can easily get the F-35Bs which have been specially designed to be operated from ACs. 

But again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint AC which in-turn won’t be feasible. Add to it, while the other 3 countries are also NATO members, US won’t be willing to allow access of F-35Bs with Indian navy officers & sailors on the AC as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of F-35Bs, which they might share with IAF, DRDO & HAL to help them make their own 5th generation AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft). 

[F\/A-18 Super Hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)

On the other hand, opting for F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. The US won’t mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to Indian Navy and Indian Airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. Indian Navy’s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of Super Hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts. 

[JSDF \(Japan\) Navy Ships during Malabar Exercise with India.](https://preview.redd.it/nfgdxqrhftq41.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1db24b91d1148a6ea32964162d21cd14b4c83df3)

Now it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the Chinese threat in IOC. It is only a matter of time coz once if PLA Navy gets its 3rd AC possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. But if India, Japan, Australia and South Korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint AC & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then China would think twice before messing with it.",2020-04-05 04:34:14
