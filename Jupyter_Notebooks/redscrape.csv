#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

A comprehensive look at Covid Surveillance and Privacy in India,133,Policy/Economy,InternetFreedomIn,g0f72k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0f72k/a_comprehensive_look_at_covid_surveillance_and/,11,1586796644.0,"https://preview.redd.it/5vdy8f5stjs41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ba025c1f8080b30fbfee028df1d46da2349d9e7

## Tl;dr

With a view to address the public health challenges due to Covid-19 a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy. We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India.  This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.

We devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing.  To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court’s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It's possible if we try!

## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off

The world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.

However, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.

Recognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.

## Overview of the working paper

This [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.

Following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person’s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.

Finally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, “.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

## We have three primary objectives from this working paper

*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.

*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.

*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don't have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?

We will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.

This working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.

- Nation's fighting well, thanks to you folk's sacrifice. ""We the people of India"" means exactly this [Starting till 4 minutes in speech].
- India started screening for COVID before the first case. At 100 cases, we started isolation. At 500 cases, we did a lockdown for 21 days [6 minutes in speech]
- It's unfair to compare with other countries. However, if we compare, India is at a relatively good standing (by around _25 to 30 times_). [8 minutes in speech]. The lockdown and social distancing was expensive but worth it. Still, _the rate of spread is alarming_ [10 minutes in speech].
- Citizens, state governments, bodies have suggested and some have _already_ implemented an extension to lockdown. **Lockdown has been extended till 3rd May 2020** (under the _same circumstances and conditions_). [12 minutes in speech].
- We have to avoid the spread of COVID in regions. Death due to this must be even more worrisome. _We must stay vigilant with current and emerging hotspots_. New hotspots will bring problems. 
    - **Stronger constraints and implementation of lockdown till 20th April 2020**. Essential services and operations can resume for areas of lower risks (under conditions for going out). _If any traces of COVID, the lockdown shall be reimposed_. [16 minutes in speech].
- _A guideline shall be released by tomorrow_ (_15th April 2020_). Major steps are taken to _help the poor and needy_. The government has helped them through various funds, specially farmers. There are efforts being made for helping farmers, supply chain is being improved [18 minutes in speech]
- We've already organized over 1L hospital beds and 600+ COVID hospitals. Scientists are encouraged to help in these times of crisis [20 minutes in speech].

### Help needed in 7 areas 
The public is encouraged to focus on the following areas [start 22 minutes in speech]:

1. _Extra care of the elderly_ in the house
2. **Obey lockdown**. Use **homemade** masks.
3. Improve immunity.
4. Download ""Aarogya Setu"" [mobile app](https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/) and encourage others to download it.
5. Help the poor and needy
6. Don't terminate employment of workers under you
7. Respect the front line workers (police, healthcare professionals, etc.)

**Please follow the above till 3 May 2020** [till 24 minutes in speech].


## Key points observed:
- PM Narendra Modi were wearing a mask which was a muffler (*Not an N95 respirator or a surgical mask*) in the beginning of the address.
- _Started at 10 AM_ and went on _till 10:25 AM_ on 14th April 2020.",2020-04-14 18:49:38

I am currently in Bangalore and my mom's treatment is undergoing in BMS hospital. The doctor prescribed two tests to know level of infection but due to lockdown next day only, it couldn't be done. Now that hospital's lab person is saying I need to wait till end of the second phase of lockdown. The particular tests(HBV DNA QUANT and SAFP) are cheaper in this hospital due to tie up with NGO. If I get these done in other hospital, I need to spend three to four times more money. With no job currently and already bad financial condition, it's really a nightmare for me. I called government hospitals also but they are not doing any test due to COVID. It's not safe to take her to crowded hospital as she has diabetes also. Please tell me what should I do in this situation. The doctor told us to get the test urgently as situation is too critical. I have tweeted to pmo for this but I think it won't reach him as he must be getting  lots of tweets. If you stay in Bangalore and know where I can get these tests in less cost, kindly let me know. Thank you for reading till the end.🙏

Got struck by a cop today,80,AskIndia,sataniscraycray,g0ybrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0ybrw/got_struck_by_a_cop_today/,51,1586865161.0,"I was out to get some meds for my mentally and physically handicapped niece. To my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask, I was stopped by a cop in civillian clothing and was asked what I was doing outside, to which I stated my reason and then was asked why I was not wearing a mask and told him the truth. I was then struck by the cop with a swat bat thingy thrice at that point, I decided to floor my bike and dipped out of there at fool speed. 

I can't help but rationlize why I was struck. My friend says that I was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. He then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (My friend btw, is Indian and lives in a Middle Eastern country). Was it right for the cop to strike me? I can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe I should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened. What do you guys think?

Edit: Thank you guys for clearing up my views on the situation of what I had gone through. I didn't mention this but, I am sort of new to India, I came here like last year to complete my UG, so I didn't take into account that the Indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where I was raised (i.e, Middle East). I admit that I was in the wrong for not wearing a mask, however, I don't think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering I showed him proof of reason as to why I was outside in the first place.

In politics we will be recognizing the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value.
In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value.

How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions?
How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life?
If we continue to deny it for long, we will do so only by putting our political democracy in peril.

My other friend says that we should just follow what ever the government has decided as they would have done more research on this matter, therefore 14 April is Tamil New Year.


I was having a hard time to research on this as I can't read/write Tamil, and Google wasn't helpful either. Would love to see any historians to shed some light in this matter for clarification, also any English sources that I can learn more of India's history.


I would appreciate if anyone can point me to some trustable resources (preferably in English). Some people say it's a political agenda, that is what Karunanidhi tried to change.

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200B;

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

These two are highly respected social activists who stood up for rights of Dalits. They've been spearheading BR Ambedkar's anti-caste movement in India.

\[1\]:  [A letter to Anand Teltumbde, on his way to jail](https://scroll.in/article/958222/a-letter-to-anand-teltumbde-on-his-way-to-jail)

They were framed in Bhima Koregaon case which you all know was transferred to centre (NIA) recently. IIMA Students/faculty wrote a letter to supreme court asking  inquiry into Prof Teltumbde arrest. They was charged under Unlawful activities act which was approved in 2019 and involves no conviction or trial. And the cases were transferred because they not longer had government in Maharashtra.

\[2\] Letter: [Statement of solidarity to Anand Teltumbe and Gautam Navlakha](https://caravanmagazine.in/noticeboard/statement-of-solidarity-to-acquit-anand-teltumbde)

And Dalits activists are far more threatening to BJP than english-speaking comedians. They've been trying their best to get these two arrested and we saw how they arrested Azad. We can't lose this battle. BJP never forms strong opinion about anti-caste movement because votes from a oppressed group is cheap and comes in massive numbers.

\[3\]. ['I Don’t See Any Anti-Caste Movement Today': Anand Teltumbde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEk9JUlIQTU)

&#x200B;

Now, finally how were they framed?

Firstly, the police claimed that they provocative speech in the Elgar Parishad event which led to violence. This wasn't proven and then they accused them of having maoist links and planning to assassinate Modi. They remotely placed letters containing ill-intent against constitution on their laptop which indicated such things. Few agencies including Amnesty and Caravan found out these irregularities. The police presented their laptops to the court and court declared them guilty.

If you're smart in politics/caste-system/tech all of you have reasons to dig into the case. And raise awareness around you. If you've friends in IIMA, they can provide you with more accurate info. The students involved are from 2-3 batches. But in any case, do learn about the whole thing happening here. They'll be arrested on Ambedkar Jayanti.

Most people that I have seen buying car are the ones spending their entire year salary's equivalent sum of money buying something they don't really need. Some people even spend amount equivalent to their two year's salary on a depreciation asset like car.

I ran numbers in different ways and realised that it's not worth the price you pay. I also found a specific kilometre number (kind of like break even for car usage) if you drive above it annually then it makes sense to go for car otherwise not.

It's easy to get a car when going out with friends or family (zoomcar etc) if you need to commute to office then two wheeler or cabs or autos are sufficient that's what I feel.

I completely understand some people buy car for reasons like status in society, comfort etc. By no means am against them, just sharing what I think.

We have a great understanding between us and we have opened up and talked about our lives before one another. I have grown up in a relatively conservative family. Although my parents were never against meeting girls (or dating one), I just could not devote any time towards it during undergraduate due to the heavy workload of an engineering degree. So this was my first real relationship and I am very happy with my partner (same age as me).

However, her undergrad life was very different, which included lots of drinking, partying, dating, sex, and several hookups. Today, she is very focussed on her career, makes healthier lifestyle choices (no more substances and drinking), and is making conscious efforts to make a life for herself that she can be proud of (she isn't proud of anything she's done in the past and has broken all ties with people from that time). To be clear, I myself have never indulged in alcohol, substances, partying, or hookups.

We both get along really well, and I have been trying to be very open-minded about her past (given that it is very much on the opposite side of the spectrum to mine). I don't want to sound regressive because I understand this happens, but I am unsure how to cope with the feelings of discomfort and off-putting mental images that come up in my mind. To add, we have decided to wait for sex until after marriage (if and when it gets to that stage in life). 

I want to deal with this because I respect her and want to be with her. Any suggestions?",2020-04-14 07:03:57

The length of operational expressways in **India** stands at 1,642.5 km: [https://i.imgur.com/FscRCi3.png](https://i.imgur.com/FscRCi3.png)

The length of operational motorways in **Pakistan** stands at 2,350 km: [https://i.imgur.com/KdZpPbW.png](https://i.imgur.com/KdZpPbW.png) (only the operational sections have been included in the calculations)

Whereas, the length of operational expressways in **China** stands at 142,500 km as of 2018 with planned expansion to 168,478 km by 2020, the list is as follows:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_NTHS\_Expressways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NTHS_Expressways)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Regional\_Expressways\_of\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Regional_Expressways_of_China) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_auxiliary\_NTHS\_Expressways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_auxiliary_NTHS_Expressways) 

&#x200B;

As it can be seen, the operational length in all three countries is drastically different. While China and India have a similar population, China has a far longer expressway system which tends to be designed more efficiently (fewer accidents) with better quality (more durable, more stops along the way with more facilites) and more lanes in general. Pakistan, on the other hand, has 1/6th the population of India but has a longer motorway system but still, it is far behind China.

This isn't a very fair comparison as there are more things to consider, Pakistan has a worse railway system than India and fewer airports even after adjusting for population. Some motorways in Pakistan are of better quality than India but some are in worse condition like the half-completed M-8 motorway and the M-9 and M-10 motorways aren't of a similar quality. China, on the other hand, has a far better railway system, more airports, etc. than both India and Pakistan. Although, India and Pakistan are both working on their respective railway systems, they are still behind (Pakistan is taking China's help in doing so). The need for longer expressways in China is crucial as it's more than 3 times the size of India (controlled area of 9,634,205 sq km vs  3,166,391 sq km) while some high-speed railway routes aren't as beneficial (but China still funds high-speed railway lines which lead to losses due to integration of far-off provinces) because of longer distances in some areas like in USA where airplanes are more preferred.",2020-04-14 04:33:23

Our beloved Modi has asked us to clang utensils and light candles. He also promised that state will take care of essential services and basic needs of citizens.

However, slowly I am coming to face the reality that shops around are out of ration.

People who used to feed the daily wagers have stopped for various reasons.

Economy went south with no chance of recovering in near future.

Whatever is left, is beyond affordable and production lines are stopped.

How long will we survive on warehouse stocks? How much time before the lockdown ends? When will the shelves be restocked (even for them to be it will take couple of weeks after lockdown ends)?

Let's not even talk about job market and havoc around it.

I believe more will die because of lockdown starvation than COVID-19. I am really anxious and worried about this scenario. Are my thoughts rational?

Do Indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?,21,Food,earnestpotter,g07a97,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g07a97/do_indian_restaurants_actually_use_yeast_to/,7,1586763183.0,"Short version:

A  naan's crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer,  it is almost hollow in the middle, no bready glutenous structures,  image for reference: [https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg)   This makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal, so a phulka like internal structure, but with tandoor's heat you'd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip, actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that?

Long version:

I'm  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  India, which I believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. While most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. I've seen   restaurants in European countries also do this, so I guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg)

Going  back to naans in India however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

The   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  The more I'm  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more I'm feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. Does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual Indian restaurants? Most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb   to naan, while I'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. I experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don't have atta) , so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ](https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ) ,

So   I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?

Endlessly refreshing for BigBasket delivery slots? Created a cross-platform program to notify you whenever a delivery slot gets available in your area.,70,Science/Technology,Drazxie,fzzcgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzzcgy/endlessly_refreshing_for_bigbasket_delivery_slots/,19,1586736363.0,"**Live at**: https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier

**Demo**: [Demo](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif?raw=true)

**Detailed Installing Instructions**: [Documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

---
This program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OS X) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid-19: A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



Some of the key features includes:

1. Cross platform system wide notifications.
1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself.
1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. Program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19, I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, However if you have any ideas to improve the section - Feel free to send a PR.

The program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [Github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

If you’ve any issues in using program, or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at: [@ugupta41](https://twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320)

But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day. 

As I said, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment and probably we won't get any. But I am trying with all my luck if some miraculous solution emerge. If it helps, he was already screened for Covid at Delhi airport and was tested negative. Also, he has been mostly living alone for the past few weeks and do not have any symptoms.

What are your thoughts on arranged marriage? And marrying someone with history of mental illness?,15,AskIndia,Neeraj1993,g06aaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g06aaf/what_are_your_thoughts_on_arranged_marriage_and/,12,1586759459.0,"I think that it is very important that a person reveals about their physical and mental health issues before marriage. Otherwise it will essentially be lying / withholding information.

Most of my friends married without revealing their struggles. I am talking about both male and female friends, from big cities and towns as well.

Obviously I don't know where they will be five or ten years from now. But as of now things seem to be going well.

Obviously I don't really know what exactly is going on in their personal lives.

The mental struggles do manifest although, and could be kept hidden for only so long.

I believe that some illnesses although are more severe than others, especially those illnesses that require antipsychotic medicines. As they can cause sexual dysfunction - erectile dysfunction.

So this could severely impact the quality of sex life of the couple. 

Other than that the mental struggles tend to be genetic. So the offspring is likely to have some positive or negative abnormalities. But it could be really positive too, as relatives of people with mental health issues can often be high achievers as well.

I myself have lived a life of honesty, so I never hide. Although people are quick to assume about the severity of the illness. And they being to imagine dramatic images of people who struggle with these illness.

So, it tends to become a conflict of interest.

So some people decide to keep things to themselves, because others might exaggerate for fun. And it might lead to them being Ostracized. 

I personally am not a big fan of marriage or seeking companionship etc although I want to conform with the social norms to some degree. And there always is interest of family members as well. 


I am not looking for advice, more of a discussion.

I wanted some help with figuring out how to proceed with life post-college. After this lockdown ends, I'll have to dive headfirst into a chaotic world, which will likely leave me with two options - getting a job or prepping for MBA. I'm currently in the final semester of a BBA program.

I don't want to end up in a corporate set-up. I sometimes doubt whether that's just because I'm shirking responsibility or I lack ambition but I think I have a few things figured out that I don't want to compromise on - reading and keeping a healthy life (which for me is basically an hour of running and basic exercises) and also that I don't care much for things like say, a car or a huge-ass house.

Keeping these things in mind, I wish to figure out a career which affords me this kind of a lifestyle and there's a balance between my interest in the job & the pay that I'll be getting from working it. Now that I've written it down, it sounds like it's too much to ask for but I believe it isn't entirely impossible. Would really appreciate ideas helping me move forward in this direction, thanks!",2020-04-13 15:57:23
"[serious] COVID-19, Help me here! where am i going wrong? (Please - I am not trying to create a panic.)",28,Coronavirus,sanjeev-v,g01wpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g01wpp/serious_covid19_help_me_here_where_am_i_going/,29,1586744741.0,"too long but please read. please do not panic over this as i may be a dumbass.

The [Mortality rate of Covid-19 in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms)  is 3.05, according to this [article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms).

The mortality rate in US is about 3.57, in Italy around 12 and in UK it's more than 12.(according to the above article)

so about 3 people die per 100 cases in India. It's scary! but not too much.

currently, mortality rate is calculated by number of death per number of cases .

    mortality rate = Total Death / Total cases

currently in world, **1,806,436** active cases and **111,722** deaths.(the curve is nowhere near flat)

mortality rate = 111722/1806436 = 6.18% worldwide.

so about 6 people die per 100 cases worldwide. It's scary! still not too much.

let's assume an [infection rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) of 20% (20 percent of population would get infected in a span of [2 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif)). 25% is the infection rate for Spanish influenza and it didn't spread to many country as covid-19, the social distancing was not that great before and there were [three waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif).

&#x200B;

now, 20% of 7.7 billion people is 1.4 billion (very huge) and 6% of 1.4 billion is 84 million(estimated death toll). 

realistically, if the infection rate is brought down to 1%(by social distancing, lock-down, etc) the death toll would still be 4.2 million. (stay the f\*ck inside home, seriously)

&#x200B;

now, my real panic is that the current mortality rate calculation takes total active cases into account( the people who got infected and are still in hospital waiting for outcome.) eventually these people will either die or get cured.

Doesn't it make sense that we should only consider the cases which had outcome for mortality rate calculation?

    mortality rate = total dead / (total discharged or cured+total dead)

In this case, 

current mortality rate = 111,722 / (413,222+111,722) = 21.3% (that's huge) (numbers from [worldometer](https://imgur.com/a/E2HZnAI))

this changes everything.

now, if the infection rate is 1%(more likely estimate) the death toll would be 16.4 million.(holy f\*uck)

which makes this one of the worst pandemics in history. 

In [India](https://imgur.com/a/vOkmjyH), 

mortality rate = 331/(1080+331) = 23.45% (which is very high, above world mean) (why are scientists saying we have low mortality rate?)

Did gov officials know about this?  or they know and they are keeping it silent to not cause any panic?

BTW, the actions taken by Indian gov is by far the best in the world.(as far as i researched) . they did bring down the infection rate by a huge factor.

&#x200B;

please help me with these questions:

* Am i doing the calculation correct or did i miss any variable? 
* Does India have huge asymptomatic cases, which were not reported?
* How did china contain this? did china actually contain this or lying about the numbers? 
* because the numbers in china are nowhere close to other countries. their mortality rate (by second method - only calculating outcomes) is 4% while for the rest of the world is 21%. it never crossed 5% at any time(very suspicious). Their mortality rate is low all the way? why all the country have similar curve except china? 
* why India is relying on Chinese model in containing this Virus?  **India should not follow Chinese model** to contain this problem.(i know medical students who are lazy to do their maths). 
* how is it possible for China to contain this as the infection rate is very high .R0 = 2.2 for covid-19, based on Chinese study  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - 34,200 in 2018/19 (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).[chinese study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/) ,  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - [34,200 in 2018/19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).
* how can we model this in India? will India be f\*ucked if there were a community spread?

Can we get some volunteers who can send me materials on how to model this properly? I know data science, i can make a website. with your help i can make some valuable prediction on how this will unfold and will give you that information for free.

My problem is a very obvious one: We are NOT testing enough. Because of this, we don’t actually have a conception of which zones are red, orange or green.

[https://www.thelallantop.com/bherant/ek-kavita-roz-padhna-likhna-seekho-by-safdar-hashmi/](https://www.thelallantop.com/bherant/ek-kavita-roz-padhna-likhna-seekho-by-safdar-hashmi/)

Woh Safdar Hashmi ki den hai. He was born today.

Safdar Hashmi was an activist and street theatre artist. and later identified with the communist ideology as well.

He was a turning point for street play and street theatre in India. His work highlighting human rights and grassroots changes irked many in the establishment. He openly mocked Indira Gandhi's grab of power of the Emergency, to government actions, government apathy, the plight of the poor and uneducated in India.

He was killed while performing a street play after he was attacked by the goons of the Congress party.

In later years the government, played this very song as a public campaign on Doordarshan.

Safdar was not killed due to his ideology. He was killed because he raised his voice, he mocked the establishment. He inspired people to be aware of their rights, to question.

This is the story the world over. This is today as well. TOday's deaths get whitewashed by a pliant media, that does not mean fundamental issues don't exist today. Or that we have benevolent Gods in power in the government.

Narendra Dabholkar, MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare , Gauri Lankesh are grim reminders today.

I know our government is doing whatever they can. I am not against them. But if they don't start testing we are not getting out of it. Because in societies that are not monitored properly people still go out carefree. Roam around for walks. And it is just scary.
And the thing is that post corona if we survive there are more problems ahead of us. I just thinking our country is coming near recession. As i would be passing out that scares me. And surely somebody's gonna respond to china in one way or another regarding the virus.

My experiment with using bumble in India.,5,Non-Political,throwawawy1999,g05iuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g05iuj/my_experiment_with_using_bumble_in_india/,32,1586756817.0,"So guys this is gonna be a bit long.                                                               
So basically I was super bored with the quarantine and I was talking to my girlfriend about random stuff. So something about online dating came up. I made a bumble profile with 3 decent pictures , a good bio ,also verified account. Guess how many matches I got ( 2 in an hour and 4 likes lol) . Bear in mind both my girlfriend and I are about a solid 9 facially  (she's a bit better maybe) but my body is  a bit above average (good frame)with slight muscle but nothing too great, but I'm on the shorter side about  5'7(I'm in South Delhi) But I certainly expected waay better results based on real life experience, I really didn't know how bad the competition is.  I wanted to see how demographics are skewed so I asked my girlfriend to send  3 random selfies  for experimenting , also none of these were taken with a proper camera(just front camera selfies) without the best lighting. Also I had no bio besides a question and my profile was unverified.  I swiped to mostly hot guys 8+, and had a 90% match rate( ridiculous). All these guys looked like models  were tall , had bodies I'd assume from more than a year of solid gymming , had great photos taken by probably a professional camera and great bio and in general had a lot of effort put on their profile all to match with a low effort unverified profile.I got 350+ likes and 100+ matches in about an hour ,hour and a half I was basically bamboozled with disparity of likes even though both of us are similarly attractive. I understand the complaints of a lot of Indian guys on bumble etc about not getting matches, but the fault is on guys and especially Indian guys y'all way too thirsty and have no or extremely low standards( bumble doesn't have a lot of white guys, almost none) the pedestalising of girls is insane. You're basically competing with Indian version of ""Chad"" if you call that if you do use online dating. The average Indian guy isn't attractive but online  there's a shit ton of ""hot"" guys in North India and most are on tinder/bumble so you'd probably get close to no matches, let alone decent ones and thats even if you're above average and have put a lot of effort in your profile. A girl in India on online dating is basically God mode. So anyone here even if you're hot guy  ( You'll probably lose your value since hot guys are dime a dozen here and fucks up the standards of all girls in general.), if you want to go for online dating.   Don't.  
1. It basically spoils the notion of love in an insane way. Basically makes it a number game which is Frankly ridiculous to me. Someone with 100+ hot guys in their profile won't be able to emotionally attach ,let alone choose between who they want. It's one of the reason is never wanted to date online even after way too many of my friends told me to. It's near impossible to find love where there isn't real time energy or connection involved.  

2. It raises the standards of even somewhat decent girls to an unattainable level for most guys who meet her and even hot guys , since all they have to do to find a hot guy is install and app an swipe. Men are probably as expendable as ever. In real life attractive people you actually come across and interact with and get along with is rare and that what makes is special(chance for a spark).  Online dating basically just gives you a plethora of these attractive people sitting at home  reducing the chances of someone being special to you way less and having a moment of actual chance encounters.(I met my girlfriend in a library, Sorry I'm a hopeless romantic)

Need help ...

And how am I gonna access a psychiatrist ...

Please help me ... If any one here is a psychiatrist or in this field .. please advise me on what to do 


It started a few days ago , I was fine and doing well Until I watched a movie about someone being falsely accused , I got intrusive thoughts that I might get falsely accused too , and my fear was escalated when I realised that I have a pretty suspicious post history on reddit and search history too , so I got really scared that I'd be falsely accused , so I did a few Google searches about weather or not i'm being tracked by the government or not , and it came with scary search results so my intrusive thoughts shifted to being spied on and falsely accused at the same time , now I don't have a lot of friends but I really value the few friends I have so I was scared that this would hurt my reputation and I would lose my current friends and not be able to make new friends either .. then later on I got so anxious and thought ""what if I am actually a criminal ? The idea didn't bother me at first but then I googled ""surpressed memories"" and I got pretty scared as well , and had the thought that I might be actually a horrible criminal and have surpressed memories of it because I cant remember doing anything bad .... I had additional intrusive thoughts as well like this world being a hallucination and that maybe in reality I'm doing some terrible things .... I was extremely scared and had a lot of anxiety ... Then later on it shifted to my current fear .. That is going to *** .... This fear is based on a dream I had a few months ago I had a dream that my life would crumble down.... And that I'd be rejected by everyone and that I'd never reach my loved ones .... I was really going through panic in my dream ... And was contemplating suicide or drugs too .... There was a figure in that dream that resembled ryuk from the anime death note ... Who was mocking me about my fate.....Right now I feel similar to that dream ..... But I have reasons to believe that this might be true Because I've been noticing various signs like scary typos while typing and ads with specific wordings etc and events like me bringing a new charger and it not working afterwords ... And me having to lay down in a specific position so it charges while using it ... Having to eat bad food etc and My mom acting weird I saw two other anime called hell girl and Babylon which scared me too ... Because both plots resemble what I'm going through I'm really anxious at this point and don't know what to do .... I'm scared and always have a feeling like I'm being watched .... I even thought to myself that if I wear this specific clothing then something scary would happen and well ... I saw the hell girl cast and had a ""hallucination"" of making a deal with the devil .. or taking a loan from a hell bank now I'm scared of going to a bank or taking out a loan I was interested in anime and now I'm scared of it .... I was interested in banking stuff and now I'm scared .... Even now I'm witnessing scary typos too .... I don't know what to do... One reason I'm scared of getting help is because ... I think that if I let my guard down or feel relieved ... Something terrible would happen ... And in Babylon ... Help from nowhere worked for the protagonist almost .... This seems similar to me .. and I'm scared of it and hope it's not .... 


Even now I'm witnessing scary signs like word suggestions , scary co incidences , someone with the username ""naively idealistic"" messaged me with kind words ... This seemed like a supernatural warning .... One thing I forgot to mention is that a main character in hell girl three vessels saw her ambitions crumble and her succeeding the hellgirl .... I don't want this to happen with me ..

Fuck I'm even having scary medical symptoms  and disturbing  typos and  signs as if telling me to not Talk about this .... .. This all seems so scary and frightening ... I'm really scared please help me

Edit : it seems to keep on getting scarier ...


Edit : I'm scared of feeling even slightly relieved or talking about this because im scared of its  repucussions if any.. it's really frightening ..

Edit : I felt a strong earthquake that seems like only I felt , idk what this was .... Now I'm really scared even more ...

Edit : just remembered that there was another character in hellgirl who was accused of something and sent to hell , don't know if falsely or not ... Now I'm even more scared..

Edit : since I seem to be more concerned about being accused... And at times I'm not much anxious.... I'm really scared.... Fuck ... I am more scared about being accused ... I don't know .... What If I appeared like a manipulator or appeared normal to a psychiatrist ?.... 

Edit : what if I'm looking like one right now ? Please .... I'm suffering .... I'm not lying about being anxious ...

Edit : more scary signs and scary thoughts ... For example ""I'm going"" and ""I'm goin"" was in a text bar ... And my phone discharged too ... And some scary  warning etc  kind of typos ..... Even when typing now ( oof more typos) and non typos in some sentences .. even now scary signs

Edit : The earthquake was in Delhi  my area 
.... The epicenter too .... Which is scary ... Inmany ways

Edit : many of the themes in that anime seem really scary and similar .... Like regret etc ....and people sending others to hell but realising their mistakes since they go to hell too .... By doing so... And other situations leading to them regretting their decisions .... I'm getting so many scary typos and signs while typing this ...

Edit : I had  a dream when I was sleeping recently about being a big criminal on the run ... And I had a dream about reading about hellgirl on Wikipedia and how disturbing it is and Hell is , I had a negative dream again wearing the same sheet ... That I wore when I had my previous negative dreams .... It's so frightening .... And I had so many scary typos typing this.... Edit of this edit : the typos were really scary like warnings even now I think 


Edit : I'm still seeing scary signs etc .... For example a sinister smile shape in a cup of tea etc .... I'm really scared .... Im scared that maybe   innocent people can be sent to hell too.  

Edit : I saw something related to the thing I think I should have avoided .... Related to banking kind of ... And I'm scared I made the wrong decision by doing so maybe ... Even my phone discharged before .... For many minutes .... Im  scared that maybe this is a pattern or symbolic or manipulated ...

Edit : still witnessing scary signs

Edit : the second previous edit is scaring me ... I'm scared that maybe I shouldn't have seen stuff related to banking ... Because it seems so symbolic and patterned

Edit : I remember being really jelous of my cousin ... And hating him ... In hell girl you can send people to hell like i said .... I don't want to be in that situation .... I have an ambition that I'm afraid of having crumbled ..... I'm unable to put it in words right now and that's what scares me because of the repucutions if any ... Of it ... I'm having negative thoughts of my close people betraying me ..... Or looking like they betrayed me or crumbling my ambition ... And i doing something terrible like sending them to hell .... And going to hell as well .... I'm seriously scared ..... 

Edit : I even had scary medical symptoms again ....
 

Edit : I'm sorry to everyone who I've wished hell and anything bad on .... I'm sorry ..... 

Edit : I tried to copy paste this to 7 cups forums but it didn't work.... I wonder what it could mean 

Edit : I saw some things ..
 That I'm scared of there .... Now I'm scared ... I don't even wanna talk about it but I'm scared that this means something and might have repucutions ....

Edit : I'm scared almost everytime and scared that I'm being watched supernaturally ....

Edit : soooooooooo I was watching hentai ... And a poster had the username ""lifeanddeathsworld"" and another ""deadstar"" ... Scary....",2020-04-13 20:45:00

Why is accent such a big thing in India?,13,AskIndia,lonelyscoopofbutter,fzylo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzylo0/why_is_accent_such_a_big_thing_in_india/,14,1586733882.0,"Hi, I always wondered about why people (not everyone) care so much about English and Accents? 

We are taught how to read, speak and write English in school at a very young age, the whole purpose of doing that is to makes us comfortable and confident in English. English is very important in Indian education system as it's the only subject which is common all across India. Even in universites they have a separate ""Professional Communication"" course where the sole purpose of the whole course is to learn how to speak like a native speaker. And even if it is not , but still, isn't the main goal of learning a language is to speak like the natives? Like German, Korean, etc? I don't know why people judge everyone because of their accent? If you have a very good accent and speak your ""Ts and Ds"" like a native speaker then you are deemed as fake and stupid and this is only limited for English! I have never seen anyone make fun of someone who was speaking, say German or Mandarin or even French, it's only specific to English. I know how Indians born and raised outside of India are treated here, people make fun of their accent or look at them funny lol. 

On the other hand, if someone doesn't have a very good accent or has a very strong Mother Tongue Influence they are treated the same way, I'm sure you have seen a ton of videos on Facebook or Instagram where people are laughed at only because they have a very bad accent or are probably trying to learn a new language. 

I don't know why people do this? I have never seen it anywhere else, everyone has a different accent and that's how it works, you can't expect 1.3B people to have a same accent all across the country. A classic example is Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone, both are international celebrities former has an Indian-American accent while latter has an Indian Accent still I see people call then ""Fake"" and ""Cringey"" lol, why? 
Why is English a set parameter for confidence and knowledge? People in South Korea, France, Norway or Germany don't speak in English and if they do they have an accent but no one cares about it but here in India it's really complicated, you should have a accent but it shouldn't be like a native speaker but you will be shamed if you have a very strong accent as it's"" funny"", if you speak in ""English"" you are confident and more intelligent than someone who necessarily isn't good at speaking English. 

Any thoughts on this?

Tldr: Learning a new language comes with an accent, it's either good (like a native speaker) or influenced by your mother tongue. It's usually fine around the world but in India is usually frowned upon, if you don't have an ""Indian Accent"": you are fake and ""angrez"" and if you have a very strong Indian accent: you are funny, not confident enough, which gives everyone a right to judge your ""knowledge"" or ""intelligence"". There's no middle ground. This is only limited to English and not to any other languages (German, French, etc.)",2020-04-13 04:54:42

Masks4allChallenge,13,Coronavirus,paddy_changemaker,fzxwqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzxwqa/masks4allchallenge/,2,1586731480.0,"Hi Friends,

This is my first post on reddit, although i have been following reddit for past 2 years. 

Countries like Czech republic and Taiwan have kept spread of virus under control by ensuring everyone wears it. This was a totally new thing for Czech Republic but as a nation they have responded amazingly. 

Me and my friends think, we will eventually have to do this in India, even after lockdown is removed. Also mass production and distribution of masks to all with take time. 

 We all have time and can contribute to this by all making a DIY mask. There are studies which clearly say that it reduces the growth rate of masks. 

We have started a #masks4allChallenge on FB and Twitter along the lines of Ice bucket Challenge which has following steps

\- Make a DIY mask  
\- Share with someone in your surrounding  
\- Tag 3 friends to take up the challenge and ask them to share in their timeline

During these tough times a lot of businesses are trying to cut costs as the situation might continue or (god forbid) worsen until a vaccine is brought to the market.

My business was started in Feb 2020 but I've been doing this online thing ever since I got my first PC in 2010.

I can help you reduce your online business costs without any personal benefit. From past few days, a couple of friends called me to help if I can reduce their costs in any way. I thought why not offer the same help to a wider audience.

So comment below and I'll reply with a suggestion. I'll not be replying to DMs for this since I want others to read the response and maybe suggest a better alternative if they know. 

Please make sure that you don't include any details that could be used by other marketing people to contact you and *sell* you their own packages.

This is just a help from my side and I don't intend to make any money out of it. Since all the replies from me would be public, anyone can verify the info and suggest a better alternative they are aware of.",2020-04-13 00:20:20

"(Story time) 13th Dec, 1971 - The day when Russian Nuclear warheads surfaced on the Bay of Bengal to stop USS Enterprise from attacking India",780,Non-Political,Saap_ka_Baap,fz62ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz62ox/story_time_13th_dec_1971_the_day_when_russian/,192,1586643187.0,"During the 1971 war between India and Pakistan for the liberation of Bangladesh (formerly known as East Pakistan), US and UK sided with Pakistan and sent their warships to India and US. 

On 13th December 1971, US President Nixon redirected the 7th Navy Fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the Bay of Bengal to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promptly called on Moscow to invoke a secret provision in the India-Soviety treaty under which Russia was bound to defend India in case of any external aggression. Russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a Nuclear submarine from Vladivostok on 13th December, 1971 under the command of Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the US Fleet to advance and attack the military bases of India. 

The only thing standing between the US Fleet and the Indian cities was the Indian Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant and the Russian fleet, so India and Russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

As the US Aircraft carrier was entering the Bay of Bengal to attack India, for the first time in human history the Russians decided to intentionally bring their Nuclear submarine to the surface and let the Americans see them.

As soon as the Russian Submarine surfaced on the Bay of Bengal, the US Admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'We are too late, the Russians are already here'
The mere fact of seeing Russian nuclear warheads in the Bay of Bengal changed America's mind and they retreated.

Russia further went on to say 'A war on India will be considered a war on Russia' and threatened China to not join the conflict on orders of the US and threatened to sink Sinkiang (a region in China) if they tried to stop India from liberating Bangladesh.

Ever since then India has considered Russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of Russian weapons and Nuclear Reactors in the world.

That's the reason a Russian president has never set foot in Pakistan.",2020-04-12 03:43:07

Muslim vendors were beaten on the streets & people are being asked not to buy anything from the shops of Muslims. This madness is not surprising anymore to us.

Actuarial student looking for some career advice.,15,AskIndia,Roastedchicken69,fzsng3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzsng3/actuarial_student_looking_for_some_career_advice/,4,1586706844.0,"Hey there internet people!

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?",2020-04-12 21:24:04

I am an American woman (26), dating a South Indian born man (32). Even though we come from contrasting backgrounds, we share the same religious beliefs (we're both Hindu), morals, and attitudes. Recently, he told me that he loves me and wants to marry me, but there is one problem: his parents. 

His parents want to arrange a marriage for him. I'm not against this practice, but I happen to love this man, and I couldn't imagine a life without him (I know, very cliche). 

I understand that since I am not an Indian woman (I'm  African-American and white), was raised Muslim (I practice Hinduism now), and that I am also the offspring of divorced and twice-married parents, that there is no way in hell my boyfriend's parents are going to approve of our marriage. 
My boyfriend is asking me to stay hopeful and travel to India with him this year so that his parents can meet me. During that time, he plans to ask his parents for their approval. 
I have been in two previous relationships where my ex-boyfriend's parents disapproved of me because I was black...and those relationships simply ended because they chose their parents over me. 

So, my question is, should I have faith in this relationship? Even though my gut is telling me that I'll never see myself married to this man? Or should I leave now before I'm disappointed and heartbroken in India?",2020-04-12 23:25:43

The best discussions are when multiple functional topics revolve around one abstract topic instead of only focusing on one facet. An understanding of the abstract is woefully incomplete when only viewed through one lens.   

To get meta for a second, this is also how we should be organizing our societies with multiple functional concepts (health, mobility, commerce, government, etc) organized around one abstract concept (an individual) instead of each facet of an individual being siloed. An understanding of an individual is also woefully incomplete when viewed through only one lens.

An Honest Conversation About Demonetization,11,Policy/Economy,facts_and_figures,fzs3p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzs3p8/an_honest_conversation_about_demonetization/,9,1586704151.0,"***Long Post Warning***

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* The excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post.",2020-04-12 20:39:11

1. The women in the gang would've already filed for sexual harassment, profanity and indecent behaviour even before the heist..

2. Moscow in his death bed would've revealed Monika was Denver's step sister 🤷🏽‍♂️

3. Professor starts taking class. The bitch Tokyo will already be messing since she hates Berlin and isn't in charge of the heist. Rio is terribly in love that he never listens to any class or keeps bunking classes and blindly listens to anything Tokyo says . Tokyo plans a riot against professor and Berlin. The plan is ruined. 

4. The female hostages would demand a separate accommodation.

5. Don't even think of the hostages changing to jumpsuits scene to be so smooth, everyone would demand a privacy 😁

6. Everyone, even after the 11th day would still have the perfect hair, makeup and those who have torn suits would have it in the right places to show off THEIR perfect biceps, abs  chest etc 😃

7. Also there would be atleast a 2 dream sequence songs.

8. Boman Irani would play Arturo Roman 

9. Their hideout during the 6 month training period would be in Leh/Ladakh or Darjeeling. 

10. Dali masks to replaced by that of BigB or Sachin Tendulkar.

11. And all this Smoking /Drinking and Abuse against women disclaimers.

12. After the success of Season 2. The role of Professor would be played by Salman Khan or Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif or Sonakshi would replace Tokyo/Nairobi in the subsequent seasons.
Role of Stockholm would be reserved for a newcomer - Probably a Star Kid..Ananya Pandey or Jhanvi Kapoor?? Coz you need to reserve one for Nepotism!

13. Modiji would've gone for Demonetization 2.0, the day after the heist is complete. #MasterStroke

I am not here to rant and rave but to show the true face of the corporate greed which clearly indicates that there's something wrong with all of this.   


To begin with, I am an entrepreneur and freelancer, having a line of credit that too with a limit of just 10,000 INR is not all that bad. However, when COVID-19 struck, I lost my clients and the due receivables from my prior clients were also stuck up. Quite reasonably, I would need to worry about my survival in a city like Mumbai and thus had whatever little I saved up in my accounts cashed due to obvious fear of not being able to pay for basic commodities. However, Slicepay through its clever legal loopholes and fuelled by its corporate hunger would not consider even a moratorium. Constant threats and random people claiming to be ""recovery agents"" have called and texted me. Even after a telephonic call with their actual staff who said I can pay it later with higher interest which I agreed to, even after that I have been completely harassed on a regular basis. 

So what is the takeaway? Well, for starters if you were thinking about this service think again. I am not an isolated example, thankfully I am a law student and caught their BS when they called my friend who also defaulted for the same reasons and said that they're in police station and are filing FIR.

But why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a start-up or taking jobs with high risk? I am not saying that working at a 9-5 job is bad, but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers, right?

In my opinion the reason why Americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt. We should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents. 

Please note that I am not judging anyone who works at a no risk job. I was just wondering why as a country we all do this. I also understand that the risk taking culture has improved in the past few years.

I have been dipping and scrubbing packed food like biscuits and chips in soapy water to disinfect them. The data online suggests that we should not do this to fruits and vegetables. I do not feel safe by just running them under water as studies say there is still chance of some virus being left ( the glitter example given by a lot of videos). 

Would products like Alum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alum, Baking Soda https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate or Vinegar disinfect the produce? As they are safe to be injested also.

Is there any scientific evidence or research done on it. 

Also, How long should fresh fruits and vegetables be quarantined to make them rid of Corona.

A Gist of Indian Innovation To Combat COVID-19,9,Coronavirus,Intepat_ip,fzjd8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzjd8h/a_gist_of_indian_innovation_to_combat_covid19/,2,1586668738.0,"The contagious COVID-19 outbreak has caused a catastrophic effect around the world. Countries are struggling to control and contain the spread of this disease. India, with its massive population, is making the best efforts to fight against the COVID-19 virus. The 21 day lockdown period has not locked down the creative minds of the researchers and engineers of our country. India supports all forms of innovations in the diagnosis, [treatment](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/), prevention, and spread of COVID-19.

We keep hearing many heart-touching stories of researchers and doctors working to combat this dreadful disease. Here is a gist of what the innovation community of India is up to and how our Government supports them.

##### Innovations across the Country

###### Triple-Layered Anti-infectious Gloves 

About 8.3% of the total cases in Italy are health workers who treat and take care of infected people. A team of Indian youngsters from Viral Brain System have realized the seriousness of this issue and have designed triple-layered gloves that are anti-infectious. The gloves not only protect the user’s hands but also disinfect everything the personal touches while wearing the gloves. These gloves, once opened, can be used for a maximum period of three days. The inner and outer layers of the gloves are made of latex, while the middle layer contains the sanitizer or any disinfecting chemical. The prototype is in testing and can be expected in the market soon.

###### Anti-bacterial Clothing

[Thermaissance](https://thermaissance.com/), a startup from the GTU-incubation center, has come up with specially designed anti-bacterial clothing for hospital staff. The innovation makes use of nano silver-based technology that is capable of destroying both positive and harmful bacteria. This reduces the risk of exposure and spread of diseases among hospital staffs that are in close contact with the COVID-19 infected people. They have also come up with cheap, anti-bacterial masks tested in a NABL accredited laboratory in Mumbai for their authenticity. The masks offer 99% protection from germs even after 60 washes.

###### Colour-changing Mask

A three-layered color-changing mask to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus is at the concept stage of innovation by the [Babaria Institute of Pharmacy](https://bitspharmacy.org/). The mask prevents the entry of Coronavirus and also acts as an indicator when exposed to the virus. The membranous layers of the mask consist of enzymes and chemical reagents that can copy DNA to RNA. When the mask comes in contact with Coronavirus particles, the mask constituents react with the virus and form a solid pink color. The change in color will indicate exposure to the virus.

###### 3-D Printed Toothbrush

The innovation from the startup, Pragratham, addresses the importance of oral hygiene in the survival rate of corona virus-infected persons. This toothbrush is specially designed for COVID-19 patients in ICU. This open-source design requires a 3-D printer and cotton gauze to construct the toothbrush. It takes an hour and 45 minutes to produce a single 3-D printed toothbrush. The product has received positive feedback when tested.

###### The Quarantine Watch App

The senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil with his team in Karnataka has launched India’s first unique mobile app to facilitate active tracking of people in quarantine. The application works on both android and iPhone platforms. The home-quarantined person should download the app, fill in essential personal details, and send selfies. The system will identify good resolution selfies, and officials from the District Photo Verification team will check for the originality of the selfie. The application has also enabled GPS tracking to trace their whereabouts effectively.

###### Online Training Programme

The Karnataka Government has launched a 1.30-2.00 hour training programme to train doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The programme is freely accessible on YouTube. The programme helps doctors to prepare themselves and also teach them on specimen collection and transport, clinical management, and supportive therapy for COVID-19 patients.

###### Sanitization Units

PadCare Labs, a Pune-based startup, has designed a sanitization unit to disinfect the surface area. The unit working on the principle of UV mechanism can disinfect an area of 80 sq ft with a 99.99% bacterial reduction in 15 minutes. The organization will be installing the units in a local hospital soon.

###### C-CAMPs Initiatives

The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms ([C-CAMP](http://www.ccamp.res.in/)) has launched COVID-19 Innovations Deployment Accelerator (CIDA) to identify and support innovations that help in combating Coronavirus. The program has partnered with Social Alpha, United Nations Health Innovation Exchange (UNHIE), India2022 Xynteo, India Health Fund, MedTechConnect, AIC-CCMB, and CCMB to select innovations and develop them to large scale applications. The companies with projects towards the following criteria were nominated for funding.

###### Preventative Measures

[Anabio](https://www.anabio.ie/) Technologies Pvt Ltd works on innovating new preventative technologies that offer better protection than the existing ones. The technology from this company aims to transform a mask or a regular cotton cloth into a protective agent against Coronavirus. This technology will work on meeting the needs of N95 masks and other personal protective equipment.

###### Diagnostics

There is a rising need in India to perform mass-testing to identify and isolate people infected with COVID-19. CoSara Diagnostics Pvt Ltd and Ampligene Diagnostics Pvt Ltd are working on developing easy-to-use, affordable, quick, and accurate diagnostic technologies.

###### Respiratory Devices

5-10% of the Indian population will require ICU in the event of community spread in India. There is a rising need for invasive and non-invasive respirators to treat critically ill patients. US FDA has approved the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines (CPAP) to meet the scarcity of ventilators. Coeo Labs and Avyantra are working on innovations in the mass production of respirators to achieve this scenario.

Many such innovations are going around in the nook and corner of our country to fight back COVID-19. Our Government has also launched several incubation programmes to encourage innovators working on combating this dreadful disease.

As per the procedure,now home ministry is one of the most important in current condition , but Amit shah who can confidently take press conferences unlike his guru is seen nowhere.

Was having a chat with a old friend who is a gujrat based journalist, he was saying that Modi dreams have got bigger and he is now aiming to become somewhat of a global icon and dreaming of a nobel prize like Obama , the reason we see him buttering international leaders like Trump and Jinping.Modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic manner.

Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.
But Shah is Shah, his entire political career is based on communal politics, and he is quite dope on that and cannot survive if he doesn't do his regular drama. 

We can see the notorius UP police filing FIRs on news channels on false reporting of Tabliki jamaat attendees , it was an outcome of Modi giving a stern warning to party top brass to not give a communal twist to corona pandemic. 

Congress has a godfather culture ,where party leaders usually don't topple their godfather.

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",2020-04-12 08:55:10

I'm right now in an area that's been sealed off. We (me and 2 very elderly parents age ~75 ) have enough food for maybe 2 months worth if stretched and medicines (insulin mostly) for the same along with a basic first aid kit. In our area ever since the barricades were put up it's been hard to access any groceries/paper cash. I'm really hoping for this to get better soon but wanted to understand from everyone else here how they're prepping. What's are things i should get once the containtment lifts? What are your preps for the lockdown? 

Thankfully I still have my high paying wfh job but have no savings, I'll be acting upon that next 2 months.Any other preps that come to mind?",2020-04-12 09:16:15

Facts why direct donation is the best:

* Instant result
* Credit goes to you, not authorities who collect the cash from you
* Lot of love from the receiver <3
* no fees, full money worth
* karma bonus points ;)
* helps keep starvation away
* more..

they are the most affected, without work, money and lots of mouths to feed. Now most of them are penniless. This vast large number of people are isolated from our thinking bubble, living area, social bubble, social media. Where do they ask for help? Who hears their struggles! While they all just worked for our comfort, the mundane things we think we don't deserve to do! 

Our society just asked all residents to fire the maids, although i fired ours month ago with extra bonus obviously, she has two children's. I'm going to send her money again soon. I'm afraid how many lakh maid and wage worker families are starving right now. Again I have zero idea.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0pdv/mark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never/

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations? Is buying your own stock also legal in India? 

If someone could also explain the situation in US and in similar context the Indian economy and situation. That will be greatly appreciated.

India to extend lockdown by 2 weeks,14,Coronavirus,TheRobotsHaveCome,fz4rsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz4rsf/india_to_extend_lockdown_by_2_weeks/,2,1586638901.0,"India is set to extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks, until April 30, as its confirmed coronavirus caseload continues to soar, with no sign that the severe restrictions on most economic activities have flattened the curve.  India confirmed its highest ever daily number of infections at 1,035 over the past 24 hours, health ministry officials said. This brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus patients to nearly 7,500. Of those, 642 have recovered, and 239 have died.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi engaged in a four-hour dialogue with chief ministers of Indian states on Saturday to discuss whether to lift the lockdown, which has caused extreme hardships to India’s hundreds of millions of casual and informal sector workers, whose incomes have collapsed since the restrictive measures were introduced on March 22.  Mr Modi made no official statement or comment after the meeting concluded. But Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of New Delhi, made it clear that the lockdown would not be lifted on April 14, when it is currently due to expire. Mr Modi is expected to address the nation on Sunday or Monday night about the extension.  Analysts and industries expect that Mr Modi may announce some relaxation of the restrictions for farmers, who are poised to harvest their annual winter wheat crop. Industrial businesses, especially exporters, are also hoping for some relaxation for manufacturers so they can maintain the supply of essential items, and fulfil international orders.  However, all India’s public transportation systems -- including urban metros rails, the railway network, and all domestic and international passenger flights -- are likely to remain suspended.

>Testing capacity in India can be increased by up to factor 10 to up to 400,000 a day (!) by doing pooled testing. E.g mix 16 samples and if negative - all are negative, otherwise binary search for the positive(s). Could of course be used worldwide. 

I guess he has been a lot into algorithms lately. Is this some kind of troll or sarcasm that i don't understand or is this even possible?

Even if we do binary search, we have to test for all of them right? I mean it's not like we need to find the positive one and then we are done, we have to find all the positive ones. What's your take on what he said?",2020-04-12 04:13:37

-------------

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

If crores of people install it, just using wireless heahphones is enough to track your location.

It picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. So even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

While I see how it will allow them to back days and see whom all an affected patient came in contact with, they also see who all you came in contact with, where you were at a point in time etc.

I am sure there are a lot of people who want to help by donating towards these causes.

Can we create a thread which will list organisations, NGOs and individual persons who are doing their bit to help others ?

If they need help, we can also list down ways in which individuals can help them, be it cash or kind.

It will also be nice to read about the small efforts being made by others to help in this crisis.

This could be added to the main covid19 thread as well.

One of my relatives died (Door ke mama) from a heart attack. He was a heart patient.

The hospital in which he was admitted told his family that you have to announce to the media that he died of covid-19 or we won't give you the body. After several requests they gave the body after 3 days (maybe after taking a large amount of money, bribe or something).

This was only because he was a muslim and this happened in a small town where hindus have already stopped buying from muslims and vice versa.

I am an exmuslim myself but when I heard this, first of all it made me sad that such things are happening in times when humanity should stand together and fight (not literally because social distancing. Hehe) but then it made realize, that coronavirus has done so much for muslims. It has killed all other causes of death itself. Now no muslim can die of heart disease or cancer or accidents etc.

Many households and companies find it difficult to cope with the current lockdown situation. As important as it is to get work turning out, it is more important to ensure the safety and well-being of all our employees. Fortunately, we at Lohono Stays have managed to tackle the challenge caused by this pandemic. Realising the density of the situation soon enough, we were able to proactively apply the work from home policy.

Applying the work from home policy well in time, helped us safeguard the interests of all our team members. However, this was not the smoothest ride. Considering our operations run in over 4 locations across India and South East Asia, we had to ensure that everybody was secure. We ensured that every staff member or villa member staying at our luxury holiday homes received the bare necessities to get through these quarantined times in perfect health. To enhance the productivity of all our team members, our CEO, Mr. Nibhrant Shah personally suggests good articles to read and encourages all to build on their skillset. Our team members are also encouraged to take up online courses, better yet we are setting up online MasterClasses for them. These will help all team members to learn and grow every day.

Our team is constantly working on improving the sanitation and comfort offered at our villas for rent in Goa, luxury villas in Lonavala, Coonoor villas for rent and private villas for rent in Alibaug. We want to be able to immediately get back into action as soon as things are up and running again. We at Lohono Stays, urge everyone to stay safe and stay at home. This battle can only be won by everyone staying indoors.
